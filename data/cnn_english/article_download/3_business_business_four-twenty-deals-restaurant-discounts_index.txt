April 20, or “4/20,” is the unofficial holiday for cannabis culture.
While the origins of “weed day” are a bit hazy — the most widely accepted story traces back to a group of California high schoolers who met at 4:20 pm to smoke marijuana — 4/20 has gained mainstream recognition in the United States and many other countries.
With recreational cannabis now legal in 24 states and Washington, DC, and medical use approved in 39 states, businesses are rolling out freebies, promos and limited-edition drops to mark the occasion.
But you don’t have to be part of cannabis culture for these deals, including burgers, cookies and more.
Munchies & fast food
Whether you’re partaking or just hungry for a good deal, a range of restaurants and fast food chains are dishing out 4/20-inspired promos. Here’s where to satisfy your cravings:
