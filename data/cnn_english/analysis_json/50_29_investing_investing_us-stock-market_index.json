    "text_summary_en": "US stocks experienced a boost due to tariff exemptions on electronics imported from China, but uncertainty surrounding the US-China trade war remains. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all closed higher after a volatile trading day. The tariff exemptions, issued after a previous tariff hike, do not apply to tariffs related to fentanyl. While tech stocks rallied, Commerce Secretary Lutnick indicated the electronics exemptions are temporary and will face separate levies later. Trump is also considering short-term tariff exemptions for automakers. The market's optimism is tempered by concerns about the economy, as indicated by rising inflation expectations and warnings from financial leaders about a potential recession. The Treasury market's recent volatility and a weakening dollar add to the uncertainty. Oil prices remained relatively stable, while gold prices declined after reaching record highs, reflecting investor demand for safe-haven assets.",
