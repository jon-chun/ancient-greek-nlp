    "text_summary_en": "A shooting at Florida State University left two dead and five wounded, allegedly perpetrated by Phoenix Ikner, the son of a Leon County sheriff’s deputy, using a handgun belonging to his mother. The article explores the potential legal ramifications for the mother, Jessica Ikner, drawing parallels to the Crumbley case in Michigan, where parents were convicted for their son's school shooting. Legal experts discuss the factors prosecutors will consider, including how the shooter accessed the gun, whether the mother knew of his potential for violence, and if there were warning signs. Ikner's history, including emotional dysregulation, extreme political beliefs, and a tumultuous childhood, are examined. The article also mentions the suspect's access to weapons due to his involvement with the sheriff's office family and training programs. While criminal charges against the mother are uncertain, a civil lawsuit is considered more likely. The investigation is ongoing, and the suspect faces potential first-degree murder charges.",
