    "title_en": "Trump administration makes major cuts to Native American boarding school research projects",
    "text_summary_en": "The Trump administration has cut at least $1.6 million in federal funding for projects documenting the abuse of Indigenous children in U.S. government-run boarding schools. These cuts, part of a broader cost-cutting effort, affect initiatives like the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition's database, which helps Native Americans find relatives who attended these schools. The cuts are seen as a setback following a federal investigation and apology by the previous Biden administration. Advocates like Deborah Parker emphasize the importance of truth in American history and the impact of these cuts on healing. The article highlights personal stories of individuals who have benefited from the research, as well as the perspectives of officials like Deb Haaland and Bryan Newland, who criticize the cuts. The cuts also affect other projects, such as oral history recordings of elders in Alaska.",
