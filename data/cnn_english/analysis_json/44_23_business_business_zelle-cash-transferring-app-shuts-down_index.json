    "text_summary_en": "Zelle, a person-to-person money transfer service, has shut down its standalone app, but the service itself remains operational. The shutdown was announced last year due to low app usage, with most users accessing Zelle through their bank's website or app. Affected users were notified and must re-enroll through their bank to continue using Zelle. Launched in 2017 by a consortium of banks to compete with Venmo and Cash App, Zelle has seen significant growth, processing over $1 trillion in transactions in 2024. However, Zelle faced a lawsuit from the CFPB alleging that it allowed fraud to occur, resulting in substantial losses for customers. The lawsuit was later dropped. The company highlights the service's value in facilitating secure money transfers between trusted individuals.",
