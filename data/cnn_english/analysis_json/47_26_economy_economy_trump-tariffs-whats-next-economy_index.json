    "title_en": "The next round of Trump’s tariffs could hurt even more. Here’s what to expect",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the potential negative impacts of President Trump's new tariffs on the US and global economy. These tariffs, including a baseline 10% tariff on all imported goods and steeper tariffs on specific countries, have already unsettled markets and increased recession risks. The article highlights immediate consequences like retaliatory tariffs and inflationary pressures, as well as near- and long-term risks such as decreased investment and a potential dollar devaluation. It also explores the possibility of additional tariffs on crucial materials like copper, computer chips, and lumber. Economists warn of potential GDP contraction, job losses, and increased inflation. The article further examines the potential impact of sectoral tariffs on industries like copper, lumber, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors, noting that these tariffs could exacerbate existing challenges like housing affordability and healthcare costs.",
