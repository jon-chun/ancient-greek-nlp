    "text_summary_en": "The Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, responding to an emergency appeal from Venezuelan immigrants in Texas. The court's order, which drew dissents from Justices Alito and Thomas, prevents the Trump administration from removing the immigrants until a federal appeals court acts on the case. The administration argues for the authority to deport the Venezuelans under other laws. Alito criticized the Court's \"hasty and premature\" intervention. The White House defended its actions, citing the need to remove dangerous illegal aliens. A federal judge had previously expressed concern but claimed lack of power to halt the deportations. The case revolves around the administration's aggressive use of the Alien Enemies Act, which allows bypassing standard immigration protocols. Lawyers for the migrants argue they received inadequate notice and opportunity to challenge their deportations. Contempt proceedings against the administration for defying an earlier order were paused by an appeals court.",
