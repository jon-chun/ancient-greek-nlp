    "title_en": "Ford Warns Dealers Prices Could Rise in June If Trump's Tariffs Remain",
    "text_summary_en": "Ford is alerting its dealers that President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported cars, which went into effect on April 3rd, may lead to increased vehicle prices. A memo to dealers indicates that these tariffs are expected to remain in place, potentially impacting vehicle deliveries starting in June, particularly those produced in May. While current inventory won't see immediate price hikes, future pricing adjustments are anticipated if the tariff policy persists. Experts predict that these tariffs could significantly raise the cost of building or importing cars, reduce vehicle supply, and potentially increase prices further with tariffs on auto parts. Despite Ford's earlier \"employee pricing\" discount, the memo suggests that tariff impacts on car prices may become unavoidable. Trump has hinted at potential changes to the auto parts tariff policy, offering some hope. The article also discusses how tariffs affect car production, supply, and demand, and consumer confidence.",
