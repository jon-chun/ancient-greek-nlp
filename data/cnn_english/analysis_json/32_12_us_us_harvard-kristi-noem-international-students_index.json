    "text_summary_en": "The Trump administration is increasing pressure on Harvard University by threatening to revoke its eligibility to host international students after freezing $2 billion in federal funding. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a letter demanding records on foreign student visa holders' activities, citing a \"hostile learning environment\" for Jewish students. This follows Harvard's refusal to comply with demands to eliminate DEI programs, ban masks at protests, and enact merit-based reforms. The administration aims to combat antisemitism and DEI practices it deems discriminatory. Jewish students at Harvard expressed concern about being used as pawns in a political agenda. The administration is also moving to revoke visas of students and faculty at other universities and considering rescinding Harvard's tax-exempt status. Noem canceled violence prevention grants for Harvard programs. Harvard maintains it will not surrender its independence. Losing SEVP certification could significantly impact Harvard's international student population and finances.",
