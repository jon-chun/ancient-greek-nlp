    "text_summary_en": "This article discusses the negative impact of President Trump's trade policies and tariffs on small businesses in the US. Several small business owners are interviewed, detailing how the tariffs have caused costs to skyrocket, disrupted supply chains, and stifled growth. These businesses, which rely on imported goods due to the infeasibility of domestic sourcing, are struggling to cope with the sudden price hikes. Economists warn of broader economic consequences, including higher costs, inflation, and potential recession. The small businesses are portrayed as being caught in the crossfire, facing potential closure and job losses. The owners express feelings of being unsupported by the government and fear for their future.",
