    "text_summary_en": "Bachir Atallah, a US citizen originally from Lebanon, claims he and his wife were detained for hours by US border agents at the Highgate Springs checkpoint in Vermont after returning from Canada. Atallah alleges mistreatment, including being handcuffed, placed in separate cells, and having his phone searched without explanation or being read his rights. He also claims that when he experienced chest pains, he was discouraged from seeking medical attention. CBP officials deny the accusations, stating that they acted according to established protocols during a routine secondary inspection. The incident has heightened Atallah's fears about returning to the US, especially given the current political climate of mass deportations and threats against US citizens. His sister, an immigration attorney, was only informed they were \"safe\" without any details of the situation.",
