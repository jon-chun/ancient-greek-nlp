    "text_summary_en": "Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion financial setback due to new US export restrictions on its H20 AI chips to China, amidst escalating US-China trade tensions. The restrictions, part of a broader effort to limit China's access to advanced technology, have led to a slump in Nvidia's stock. The H20 chip, designed to comply with previous export rules, is now subject to licensing requirements. Analysts view this as a strategic blow to Nvidia's engagement with Chinese customers. The move follows the rise of Chinese AI models like DeepSeek's R1, trained using H20 chips, prompting calls for tighter export controls. The US Commerce Department confirmed the new licensing requirements, citing national and economic security. The WTO forecasts reduced global economic growth due to the trade war. Nvidia warns that the restrictions jeopardize global AI progress and innovation. Other companies like AMD are also affected.",
