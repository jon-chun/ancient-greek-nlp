    "text_summary_en": "Phoenix Ikner, a Florida State University student, is accused of a shooting that killed two and injured six. He is the son of a local sheriffâ€™s deputy and had prior involvement with law enforcement training programs. The motive is unknown, and there appears to be no connection between Ikner and the victims. Classmates described Ikner's political beliefs as extreme, citing instances of concerning rhetoric. Ikner had a tumultuous childhood, including a custody battle where his biological mother was accused of taking him out of the country. Authorities recovered multiple firearms from Ikner's car. He is currently hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries and will face charges, including first-degree murder. Ikner had been prescribed medication for emotional dysregulation but had reportedly stopped taking it. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are exploring potential connections to a student protest.",
