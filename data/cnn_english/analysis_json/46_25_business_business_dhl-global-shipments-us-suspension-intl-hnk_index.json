    "title_en": "DHL to suspend global shipments of over $800 to US consumers",
    "text_summary_en": "DHL Express announced it will suspend global business-to-consumer shipments exceeding $800 to US individuals, effective April 21, due to new US customs regulations that require formal entry processing for all shipments over $800, a significant reduction from the previous $2,500 threshold on April 5. Business-to-business shipments will not be suspended but may experience delays. Shipments under $800 remain unaffected. DHL stated this is a temporary measure. This follows Hongkong Post's suspension of sea mail services to the US, citing \"bullying\" after the US canceled tariff-free provisions for packages from China and Hong Kong. DHL had previously stated it would continue processing shipments from Hong Kong in accordance with customs rules and would assist customers in adapting to changes planned for May 2.",
