    "title_en": "In China’s ‘Christmas Town,’ Trump’s tariffs are dimming the lights",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Yiwu, China, a city known as \"Christmas Town\" for producing a significant portion of the world's Christmas decorations. The tariffs, exceeding 145%, have disrupted trade relationships, causing vendors to lose customers, reduce profits, and seek alternative markets. Many vendors express concern and confusion over Trump's actions, hoping for a resolution. The article highlights the broader implications of the trade war, including potential global recession and shifts in consumer spending. Some vendors are pivoting to the EU market or focusing on domestic sales. While some support China's response, there's widespread fear about the future of Yiwu and its residents. The article concludes with the sentiment that the trade war has damaged relationships and altered consumer behavior.",
