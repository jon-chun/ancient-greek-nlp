    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the potential negative impacts of President Trump's decision to impose new tariffs on America's trading partners. Economists predict a likely recession in the US and globally if the tariffs remain in place, leading to increased prices, job losses, and economic downturns. The tariffs are described as a \"US tax increase\" that will exacerbate inflation. Retaliatory measures from other countries like the EU and China are expected, further impacting the global economy. While the US aims to boost its manufacturing sector, the tariffs could disrupt supply chains, increase bureaucracy, and harm businesses. Consumers both in the US and abroad could face higher prices due to these tariffs and retaliatory measures. Despite some analysts believing a global recession can be avoided, the overall economic growth is expected to weaken significantly.",
