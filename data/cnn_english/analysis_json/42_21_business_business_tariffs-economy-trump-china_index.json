    "title_en": "Trump Official Says Tariff Exemptions on Tech are Temporary. Elizabeth Warren Calls Trade War ‘Red Light, Green Light’ Game",
    "text_summary_en": "Commerce Secretary Lutnick stated that tariff exemptions on electronics are temporary, with semiconductor tariffs coming soon. President Trump clarified that no one is \"off the hook\" and products are moving to a different tariff \"bucket.\" Senator Warren criticized the tariff shifts as \"chaos and corruption,\" likening it to a \"red light, green light\" game. Analysts initially saw the exemptions as positive for tech investors. However, tariff uncertainty has negatively impacted the stock market and consumer sentiment, raising recession fears. Trump officials maintain tariffs will strengthen the economy. There's confusion about the rules, with economists criticizing the policy. China has retaliated with tariffs, but officials indicate they won't increase them further. Other countries are negotiating tariffs with the US, excluding China for now. The possibility of China selling US assets is not part of the plan.",
