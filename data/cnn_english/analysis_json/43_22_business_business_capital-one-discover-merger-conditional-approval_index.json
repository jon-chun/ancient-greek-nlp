    "title_en": "The Capital One merger with Discover just cleared a major hurdle",
    "text_summary_en": "Capital One received approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to merge with Discover Financial Services. A condition of the approval requires Capital One to address issues related to enforcement actions against Discover Bank. The deal would strengthen Capital One's position against competitors like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, and provide a new revenue stream from merchant fees. While the merger could increase merchant acceptance rates for Discover customers, it also carries the risk of higher interest rates, as Capital One historically caters to customers with lower credit scores. The Fed also announced a $100 million penalty for Discover for overcharging interchange fees. The Trump administration is perceived as more merger-friendly, which positively impacted the stock prices of Capital One and Discover after the election.",
