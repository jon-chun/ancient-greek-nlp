    "title_en": "Why China's Curbing of Rare Earth Exports is a Blow to the US",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses China's recent export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, highlighting the significant impact on the US due to its reliance on China for these critical materials. These restrictions are seen as retaliation in the escalating trade war between the two countries. The article explains the importance of rare earths in various high-tech and defense industries, noting China's dominance in their extraction and processing. The US is heavily dependent on China for these resources, making it vulnerable to supply disruptions. The article also mentions Trump's efforts to boost domestic production and explore alternative sources, such as Ukraine and Greenland, but also notes the challenges and potential costs associated with diversifying supply chains. The long-term implications include potential shortages, price increases, and the need for substantial investment in domestic production capabilities.",
