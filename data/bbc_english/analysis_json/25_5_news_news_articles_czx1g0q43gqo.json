    "text_summary_en": "Astronaut Don Pettit, the oldest serving US astronaut, returned to Earth on his 70th birthday along with Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner after spending 220 days on the International Space Station (ISS). Their Soyuz capsule landed in Kazakhstan. Pettit has spent a total of 590 days in space across four missions, though he is not the oldest person to fly in space, a record held by John Glenn. The crew will readjust to gravity before Pettit returns to Houston and his Russian counterparts go to Star City near Moscow. Command of the ISS was handed over to Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi. The article also mentions the delayed return of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who spent significantly longer than planned on the ISS due to technical issues.",
