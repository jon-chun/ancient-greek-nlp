    "text_summary_en": "This article discusses the case of Lina, a woman in Spain who was murdered by her ex-partner after being assessed as \"medium\" risk by VioGén, a police algorithm used to predict domestic violence. The article raises questions about the accuracy and effectiveness of VioGén and similar tools used in other countries. It explores whether the algorithm's assessment influenced the denial of a restraining order and highlights concerns about potential algorithmic bias and lack of independent audits. The article also presents different perspectives on VioGén's value, with some officials defending its importance while critics point out its limitations and potential for error. The impact of Lina's death on her family and community is also discussed.",
