    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses Apple's reliance on China for manufacturing, highlighting both the benefits and vulnerabilities this creates, especially in light of US-China trade tensions and potential tariffs. Apple's deep integration with China's manufacturing ecosystem, particularly through Foxconn, has been crucial to its success. However, this dependence makes Apple susceptible to political and economic pressures. The article explores the possibility of Apple shifting production to the US or other countries like Vietnam and India, but notes the challenges and limitations. It also mentions the rising competition from Chinese smartphone companies and the impact of Chinese government policies on Apple's operations in China. The article concludes that while Apple has mitigated some immediate risks, the long-term uncertainty surrounding US-China relations and potential tariffs will continue to pressure Apple's supply chain.",
