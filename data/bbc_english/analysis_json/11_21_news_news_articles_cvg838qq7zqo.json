    "title_en": "Why everyone is suddenly so interested in US bond markets",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the recent volatility in the US bond market following the introduction of trade tariffs. Normally a safe haven, US government bonds experienced a sell-off as investors grew uncertain about the impact of tariffs on the US economy. This led to a sharp increase in bond yields, reflecting a higher perceived risk. The article explains how this affects ordinary Americans through potential increases in borrowing rates for mortgages, credit cards, and car loans, and how it could impact businesses, especially small ones. The bond market reaction is compared to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK. The article also touches on China's role as a major holder of US debt and the potential implications of its actions. Ultimately, the bond market's reaction prompted President Trump to pause the higher tariffs, except for those on China, highlighting the market's influence on policy.",
