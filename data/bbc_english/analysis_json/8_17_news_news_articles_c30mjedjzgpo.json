    "title_en": "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the potential unintended consequences of Donald Trump's focus on securing critical minerals for the US. Despite his climate change skepticism, Trump's pursuit of these minerals, essential for both aerospace/defense and green technologies, could inadvertently boost the US green technology sector. The article highlights the US's current dependence on China for critical mineral processing and the risks associated with it. It also touches upon the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its impact on green industry investment, particularly in Republican-held states. The article suggests that Trump's actions, driven by economic and strategic concerns, could lead to increased domestic mining and processing of these minerals, potentially fostering growth in the green technology sector, even as his overall stance on climate change remains unchanged. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the IRA and the US's international climate commitments is also discussed.",
