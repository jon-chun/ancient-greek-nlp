    "text_summary_en": "Astronaut Don Pettit, the oldest serving US astronaut, returned to Earth on his 70th birthday along with Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner after spending 220 days on the International Space Station (ISS). Their Soyuz MS-26 capsule landed safely in Kazakhstan. This was Pettit's fourth mission, bringing his total time in space to 590 days, although John Glenn remains the oldest person to fly in orbit. The crew will readjust to gravity before Pettit returns to Houston and his colleagues to Star City near Moscow. Command of the ISS was handed over to Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi. The article also mentions the delayed return of Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who spent over nine months on the ISS due to technical issues.",
