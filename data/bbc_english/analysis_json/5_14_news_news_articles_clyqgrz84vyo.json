    "title_en": "Hereditary Lords speak out on prospect of leaving Parliament",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the impending removal of hereditary peers from the House of Lords due to the government's House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) Bill. Several hereditary peers, including the Earl of Devon, Lord Thurso, Lord Howe, and Lord Hacking, share their perspectives on this change. The Earl of Devon expresses a mix of resignation and a desire to amend discriminatory inheritance rules. Lord Thurso welcomes the change but believes it's a superficial fix to a deeper problem with the Lords' legitimacy. Lord Howe reflects on his fulfilling experience in the Lords, while Lord Hacking, a Labour hereditary peer, supports the removal with some regret, hoping for life peerages for the best hereditary peers. The article explores the historical context of hereditary peerages and the varying viewpoints on their continued role in Parliament.",
