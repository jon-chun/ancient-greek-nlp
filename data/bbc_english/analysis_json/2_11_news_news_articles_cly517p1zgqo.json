    "title_en": "US Plans Port Fees on Chinese Ships",
    "text_summary_en": "The US is planning to impose port fees on Chinese ships to revitalize American shipbuilding and challenge China's industry dominance. Starting mid-October, Chinese ship-owners will face fees of $50 per ton of cargo, increasing annually for three years. While concerns exist about further global trade disruption following President Trump's tariffs, the fees are less severe than initially proposed. China's foreign ministry argues the fees will raise prices for US consumers and fail to revitalize the US shipbuilding industry. The fees will be based on cargo weight, container count, or vehicle number, with exemptions for empty vessels and those moving goods between US ports and territories. A second phase will favor US-built LNG ships. Trump's existing tariffs have already caused cargo diversions to Europe, increasing congestion and prices.",
