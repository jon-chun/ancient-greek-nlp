    "title_en": "Ukraine Minerals Deal May Not Buy Peace After Trump Threat",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses a potential mineral deal between Ukraine and the US, where the US would invest in Ukraine's recovery in exchange for a share of profits from its natural resources. This deal was accompanied by initial peace talks involving American, European, and Ukrainian officials. However, President Trump threatened to withdraw from brokering a ceasefire unless progress was swift. The article suggests that this threat, along with paused military aid to Kyiv and improved relations with Moscow, favors the Kremlin more than Ukraine. Despite Moscow's claims of striving for peace, it continues attacks on Ukrainian civilians. The article raises concerns about whether the US prioritizes its commercial interests over who controls Ukraine in the long term, and questions whether the mineral deal is more of a business venture than a genuine effort to secure peace. It also highlights the potential consequences for other Baltic countries if Russia occupies all of Ukraine.",
