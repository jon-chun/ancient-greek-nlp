    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the potential appointment of billionaire Jared Isaacman as the new head of NASA, nominated by Donald Trump. It explores the implications of this appointment, particularly given Isaacman's vision for democratizing space travel and Trump's aim to cut the federal budget with Elon Musk's help. The article contrasts Isaacman's entrepreneurial approach with the traditional, often costly, methods of NASA, highlighting the rising competition from private space companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. It questions the future of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) due to its high costs compared to reusable rockets developed by private companies. The article also touches upon the potential changes Isaacman might bring, including increased privatization, program cuts, and a shift in focus towards Mars. It acknowledges the political challenges in implementing such changes due to congressional interests and the historical importance of NASA, while emphasizing the need for reform within the agency.",
