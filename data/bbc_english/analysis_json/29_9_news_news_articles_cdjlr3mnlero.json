    "text_summary_en": "Donald Trump and Giorgia Meloni discussed the possibility of a trade deal between the US and Europe during Meloni's visit to Washington. Trump expressed confidence in securing a \"fair deal,\" while Meloni aimed to bridge relations between the EU and the US, despite existing trade tensions and tariffs. Trump also mentioned potential deals with China. Meloni's visit was described as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's tariffs on foreign imports. While she didn't achieve immediate tariff concessions, she secured an invitation for Trump to visit Rome and potentially meet with EU leaders. Meloni aligned herself with Trump's viewpoints, criticizing \"woke ideology\" and championing efforts against illegal migration. She also promoted Italy's economic stability and improvements. The meeting was perceived positively, with discussions covering defense spending, immigration, and tariffs.",
