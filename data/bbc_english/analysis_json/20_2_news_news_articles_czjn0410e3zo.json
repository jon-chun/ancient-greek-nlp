    "title_en": "Thousands Join Anti-Trump Protests Across US",
    "text_summary_en": "Thousands of people protested against President Trump's recent actions across the US, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the American Revolutionary War. The protests, known as \"50501,\" addressed various grievances, including the deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García and Trump's government efficiency initiative. While protests were mainly peaceful, one incident involved a confrontation with a Democrat representative. Trump's approval ratings have slightly decreased since he took office, especially regarding his handling of the economy. The article also mentions larger nationwide protests earlier in the month. The protests reflect growing opposition to Trump's policies and performance, with demonstrators expressing concerns about liberty and government actions.",
