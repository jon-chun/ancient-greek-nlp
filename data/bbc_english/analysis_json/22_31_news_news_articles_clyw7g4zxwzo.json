    "text_summary_en": "Lina, a victim of domestic abuse in Spain, was assessed as \"medium\" risk by the VioGén algorithm. Despite her fears and a request for a restraining order, which was denied, she was murdered by her ex-partner. This incident raises questions about the efficacy and potential biases of VioGén, a system used to assess the risk of repeat domestic violence. While VioGén is considered \"super-important\" and helpful in allocating resources, critics suggest police may be over-reliant on it. Studies on algorithmic bias show that similar systems have misclassified risk for minority groups. An independent audit of VioGén was proposed but denied. The article explores the debate around the algorithm's accuracy, transparency, and impact on judicial decisions, highlighting the need for further investigation and potential improvements to ensure women's safety.",
