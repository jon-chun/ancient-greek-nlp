    "title_en": "Trump's Trade Policies Undermine US Economic Foundations: A Messy Fallout",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports, arguing that this protectionist policy reverses decades of US-led globalization and free trade. It criticizes the rationale behind these \"reciprocal\" tariffs, which are based on trade deficits rather than actual trade barriers, and highlights the potential negative consequences for the US economy, including inflation and recession. The article contrasts Trump's policies with the traditional economic theory of comparative advantage and points to the \"China shock\" as a key influence on his thinking. While acknowledging the potential for some job creation through reshoring, the article emphasizes the overall negative impact on US businesses and consumers, as well as the potential for retaliatory measures from other countries. It concludes that the transition away from globalization will be messy and that the US is potentially harming its own interests.",
