    "text_summary_en": "A US judge has ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in online advertising technology, siding with the US Department of Justice and 17 states. This is Google's second antitrust loss in a year, following a ruling against its online search monopoly. Google plans to appeal. The judge found Google engaged in anticompetitive acts that harmed publishers and consumers. While Google won on one count, the ruling is seen as a significant victory for antitrust enforcers. Experts believe it sets a legal precedent impacting corporate decision-making. Google argues the case focuses too much on its past and ignores competitors like Amazon. The ruling could lead to structural changes in Google's ad exchange practices and potentially a break-up of Alphabet, Google's parent company. Similar antitrust concerns are being investigated in the UK.",
