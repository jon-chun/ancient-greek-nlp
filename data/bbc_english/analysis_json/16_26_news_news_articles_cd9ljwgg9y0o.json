    "title_en": "Trump's Chips Strategy: The US Will Struggle to Take on Asia",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the challenges the US faces in competing with Asia in the semiconductor industry, particularly under President Trump's policies. Despite efforts like the CHIPS Act to incentivize domestic manufacturing, the US struggles with high costs, skilled labor shortages, and construction delays. Taiwan, South Korea, and China have invested heavily in chip manufacturing, creating a complex, integrated ecosystem that's difficult to replicate quickly. Trump's tariff policies and immigration restrictions further complicate the situation. While some companies are investing in US facilities, most advanced chip production remains in Asia. The article suggests that protectionism and isolation are not effective strategies, and that collaboration in a globalized economy is key to success in the semiconductor industry. Other countries like India may become important players. Trump's approach is viewed as a bargaining tactic, potentially forcing deals between US and Asian companies.",
