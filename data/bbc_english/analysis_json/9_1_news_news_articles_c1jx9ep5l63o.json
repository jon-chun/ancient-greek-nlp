    "title_en": "DHL Suspends High Value US Deliveries Over Tariffs",
    "text_summary_en": "DHL Express is halting deliveries to the US for shipments exceeding $800 due to increased customs red tape following the introduction of new tariffs by Donald Trump. This suspension, effective Monday, applies to shipments from companies to American consumers, while business-to-business shipments may face delays. The change stems from tighter customs checks and a lowered threshold, causing a surge in formal customs clearances. The White House plans to further clamp down on deliveries under $800, particularly from China and Hong Kong, by removing the \"de minimis\" rule on May 2, impacting companies like Shein and Temu, who anticipate price increases. The Trump administration claims the measures target illicit substances concealed in shipments from China, addressing the synthetic opioid crisis. In response, Hongkong Post is suspending sea shipments to the US and halting parcel acceptance from April 27, criticizing the US for \"unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively.\"",
