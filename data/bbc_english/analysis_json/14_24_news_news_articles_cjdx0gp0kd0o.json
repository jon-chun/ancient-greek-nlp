    "text_summary_en": "US Senator Chris Van Hollen reports that Kilmar Ábrego García, mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration and accused of MS-13 membership, has been moved to a new prison after being \"traumatised\" in the notorious Cecot mega-jail. Despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return, the White House opposes his return, citing his alleged gang affiliation. Van Hollen visited Ábrego García in El Salvador and advocates for his due process rights, regardless of the allegations against him. The case highlights a conflict between the Trump administration and the US courts on immigration issues. Ábrego García's family denies his gang membership, and Van Hollen criticizes the administration for making claims outside of court. The article also mentions past allegations of criminal activity against Ábrego García that did not result in convictions.",
