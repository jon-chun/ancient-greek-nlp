    "text_summary_en": "A Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario, is temporarily shutting down due to US President Trump's car tariffs, causing anxiety among Canadian workers. The US has implemented a 25% tariff on foreign-made vehicles, which is halved for cars with at least 50% US-made components. Canada plans to retaliate with its own 25% tariff on American-made cars, with exemptions for vehicles compliant with the existing North American free trade agreement. Canadian political leaders are proposing solutions, such as removing federal tax on Canadian-made cars or issuing \"Victory Bonds.\" The integrated nature of North America's car manufacturing sector, where components cross borders multiple times, complicates the situation. The shutdown affects workers in Canada, Mexico, and the US. Car prices are expected to rise, and the tariffs pose administrative challenges. Workers hope for a negotiated deal but also believe Canada must stand up for itself.",
