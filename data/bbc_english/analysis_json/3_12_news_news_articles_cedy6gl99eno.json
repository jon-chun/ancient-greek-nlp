    "title_en": "Nvidia: The AI chip giant caught between US and China",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses Nvidia's position as a key player in the AI chip market amid rising tensions between the US and China. The US government has imposed new export controls on Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China, aiming to slow China's AI development and secure an advantage in AI competition. Nvidia's CEO visited Beijing to maintain business relations despite the restrictions. While China is developing its own AI chips, Nvidia's technology is currently superior. The export controls are expected to impact Nvidia's revenue and may prompt China to accelerate its domestic chip development. The situation reflects a broader trend of technological polarization between the US and China, with both countries seeking to secure their supply chains and advance their AI capabilities.",
