    "title_en": "Trump's Tariffs Create an Impossible Choice for China's Neighbors",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the impact of potential Trump tariffs on Southeast Asian economies, particularly Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Cambodia. While previous tariffs created opportunities for some businesses to compete with restricted Chinese exports, new tariffs threaten to shut these doors. These countries are caught between their strong trade relationship with China and their reliance on the US as a key export market. Xi Jinping's recent visit to the region highlights China's efforts to strengthen ties and resist US pressure. Southeast Asian nations are scrambling to navigate this complex situation, with some offering trade concessions to the US while also facing a surge of cheap Chinese imports that harm local businesses. The article suggests that this situation serves as a wake-up call for the region to diversify its trade dependencies.",
