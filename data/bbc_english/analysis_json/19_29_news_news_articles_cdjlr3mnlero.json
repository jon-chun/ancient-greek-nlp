    "text_summary_en": "Donald Trump and Giorgia Meloni discussed the possibility of a US-Europe trade deal during Meloni's visit to Washington. Trump expressed confidence in securing a \"fair deal,\" while Meloni aimed to bridge the gap between the US and EU amidst trade tensions. Trump also mentioned potential deals with China. Meloni's visit was seen as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's tariffs on foreign imports. While she didn't achieve immediate tariff concessions, she secured Trump's agreement to visit Rome and potentially meet with EU leaders. Meloni aligned herself with Trump's viewpoints, criticizing \"woke ideology\" and advocating for stricter immigration policies. She also highlighted Italy's improved economic situation under her leadership. The meeting also touched on defense spending, with Meloni indicating Italy's commitment to meeting NATO's 2% GDP target. Overall, the visit aimed to strengthen US-Italy relations and foster dialogue between the US and EU.",
