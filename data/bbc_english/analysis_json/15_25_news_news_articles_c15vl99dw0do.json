    "title_en": "What Trump Really Wants from Canada",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses escalating tensions between the US and Canada, particularly since Donald Trump's return to the White House. Disputes range from lobster fishing rights in the \"Grey Zone\" to potential US interest in Canadian water resources and rare earth metals. Trump's rhetoric about annexing Canada and making it the \"51st state\" has alarmed Canadian leaders, who fear economic collapse and US dominance. The article explores the historical context of US-Canada relations, suggesting a potential shift in US foreign policy towards prioritizing its \"territorial core\" and resource control. Experts debate whether Trump's actions are part of a coherent strategy or simply impulsive whims, but agree that the diplomatic damage is significant. The article concludes with concerns about broken trust and potential consequences, including boycotts and a readiness for conflict from Canada.",
