    "text_summary_en": "US Senator Chris Van Hollen reports that Kilmar Ábrego García, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been moved to a new prison. Ábrego García was initially held in the notorious mega-jail Cecot and was reportedly \"traumatised\" and fearful. Despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return, the Trump administration refuses, accusing him of MS-13 membership. Van Hollen visited Ábrego García in El Salvador and is advocating for his due process rights, emphasizing that Ábrego García has never been convicted of a crime. The senator expressed frustration with the Trump administration's handling of the case. The White House insists he will never return to the US, citing his alleged gang affiliation. The case highlights a conflict between the Trump administration and the US courts over immigration and due process.",
