    "title_en": "Why everyone is suddenly so interested in US bond markets",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the recent volatility in the US bond market, triggered by concerns over trade tariffs and their potential impact on the US economy. Traditionally seen as a safe haven, US government bonds experienced a sell-off, causing interest rates to rise. This has implications for ordinary Americans and businesses, as it could lead to higher borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and business loans. The article draws parallels with Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, which also spooked bond markets. The article suggests that the bond market's reaction influenced President Trump to introduce a pause on tariff increases, highlighting the market's power. The article also touches upon China's significant holdings of US debt and whether they played a role in the sell-off. Ultimately, the article suggests the turmoil could lead to an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar.",
