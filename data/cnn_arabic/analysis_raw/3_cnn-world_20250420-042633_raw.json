The proposal also includes a ceasefire along the front lines of the conflict. European and Ukrainian officials were briefed on the framework in Paris, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was informed during a phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Some elements of the framework still need completion, and the US plans to collaborate with European and Ukrainian officials next week in London. Trump indicated he might withdraw from mediating a peace agreement if no swift resolution is reached.\n\n---\n\n1. **Topic: US Recognition of Russian Sovereignty over Crimea**\n   - Sentiment Polarity Analysis:\n     - Explanation/Justification: The sentiment is mixed; while the proposal indicates a willingness to negotiate, it also suggests a concession to Russia, which may be viewed negatively by Ukraine and its allies.

The phrase \"وقفا لإطلاق النار\" (ceasefire) suggests a hopeful step towards peace.\n     - Polarity Score: 0.6\n     - Confidence: 85\n\n   - Emotional Weights Analysis:\n     - Justification: The ceasefire proposal generates anticipation and joy among those seeking peace, while also eliciting fear regarding the potential for continued conflict.\n     - Emotion Dictionary:\n       - Joy: { \"weight\": 0.7, \"confidence\": 80 }\n       - Trust: { \"weight\": 0.6, \"confidence\": 75 }\n       - Fear: { \"weight\": 0.4, \"confidence\": 70 }\n       - Surprise: { \"weight\": 0.3, \"confidence\": 60 }\n       - Sadness: { \"weight\": 0.2, \"confidence\": 50 }\n       - Disgust: { \"weight\": 0.1, \"confidence\": 40 }\n       - Anger: { \"weight\": 0.2, \"confidence\": 55 }\n       - Anticipation: { \"weight\": 0.9, \"confidence\": 90 }\n\n3. **Topic: Trump's Mediation Role**\n   - Sentiment Polarity Analysis:\n     - Explanation/Justification: Trump's willingness to withdraw from mediation if no quick agreement is reached reflects a negative sentiment towards the ongoing negotiations, indicating impatience and frustration.
