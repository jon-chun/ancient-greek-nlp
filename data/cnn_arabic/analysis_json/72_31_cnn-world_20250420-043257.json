    "title_en": "Russian Foreign Minister Calls on World Countries Regarding Trump's Tariffs",
    "text_summary_en": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the World Trade Organization (WTO) is \"paralyzed\" due to successive US administrations and called for peaceful agreements on tariffs between the US and other countries. He expressed hope that countries can reach mutually beneficial agreements with the US. Lavrov also noted the lack of a globally trusted institution. The Kremlin earlier this week said it was closely monitoring global oil prices, which fell after President Trump imposed high tariffs on numerous countries. The article conveys a sense of concern about the current state of global trade and the impact of US tariff policies.",
