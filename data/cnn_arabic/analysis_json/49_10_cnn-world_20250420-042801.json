    "title_en": "After Freezing Grants... Trump Administration Threatens to Deprive Harvard University of Accepting International Students",
    "text_summary_en": "The Trump administration, through Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, is threatening to revoke Harvard University's ability to accept international students if it fails to provide records of \"illegal and violent\" activities by international students by April 30, 2025. This action follows the cancellation of $2.7 million in federal grants to Harvard. The administration accuses Harvard of creating a \"hostile learning environment\" for Jewish students and demands information on threats made by visa holders. Harvard maintains it will not compromise its independence or constitutional rights and expects federal actions to be based on evidence and due process. This is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to combat antisemitism on college campuses, including freezing grants and contracts, demanding policy changes related to diversity programs and protest restrictions, and revoking visas of students and faculty.",
