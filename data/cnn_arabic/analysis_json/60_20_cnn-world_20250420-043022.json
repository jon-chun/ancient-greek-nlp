    "title_en": "Satellites Reveal North Korean Military Secret... Experts Warn",
    "text_summary_en": "New satellite images reveal what could be North Korea's largest warship ever, potentially twice the size of any ship in Kim Jong Un's naval fleet. The ship is under construction at the Nampo shipyard and is likely a guided-missile frigate (FFG) designed to carry missiles for use against land and sea targets. Analysts suggest the ship's construction is ongoing, with weapons and internal systems being installed. The existence of the warship isn't surprising given North Korea's push to modernize its military, despite UN sanctions. However, closer ties with Russia may be helping North Korea circumvent these sanctions. Experts caution against overstating the ship's capabilities, highlighting the challenges of integrating complex systems. The article raises questions about North Korea's technical capabilities and the financial burden of operating such a warship. The potential deployment of a hypersonic ballistic missile on the frigate could significantly impact regional security. Despite North Korea's large naval fleet, most of its ships are outdated, making this new warship a significant development.",
