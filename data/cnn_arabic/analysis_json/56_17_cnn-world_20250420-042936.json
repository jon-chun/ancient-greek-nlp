    "text_summary_en": "This article is an opinion piece by Lebanese journalist and writer Omar Harkous, reflecting on his seven years working at Alhurra TV. He describes the challenges of reporting on news, revolutions, wars, protests, and explosions, while striving for neutrality and objectivity, but always siding with victims. He recounts the establishment of the news department in Dubai, the pursuit of truth amidst competition, and the constant changes influenced by political shifts in Washington. He highlights the threats faced by colleagues on the ground, requiring caution when covering sensitive issues. He mentions specific cases in Iraq, Beirut, and Sudan, as well as the coverage of events in Iran and Gaza. The author emphasizes Alhurra's commitment to covering topics often avoided in Arab media, such as the plight of the Yazidis and Baha'is, and the conflicts in Syria and Palestine. He concludes by lamenting the closure of Alhurra after 21 years, attributing it to the influence of Donald Trump.",
