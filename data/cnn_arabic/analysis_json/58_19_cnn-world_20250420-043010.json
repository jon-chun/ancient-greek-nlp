    "text_summary_en": "US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, suggests that commercial opportunities for Russia with the US and Europe could be part of an emerging deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Witkoff, an envoy for former US President Donald Trump, stated on Fox News that a significant agreement for the world might be near, potentially reshaping US-Russia relations through promising commercial opportunities, fostering regional stability. He met with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg, gaining insight into Putin's requirements for a peace agreement. Witkoff mentioned this was his third meeting with Putin, the latest lasting about five hours, focusing on achieving a lasting peace beyond just a ceasefire. He did not disclose Putin's specific demands for peace, and CNN has reached out to the Kremlin for comment.",
