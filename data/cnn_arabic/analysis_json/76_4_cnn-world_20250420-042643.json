    "text_summary_en": "A source familiar with the peace negotiations in Ukraine told CNN that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was \"expressing the President's views\" in his comments that the United States would \"move on\" if the war in Ukraine could not be ended. The source described the administration's thinking on the conflict, stating that Trump \"has no unlimited patience for some to play games and brag.\" The source said Rubio was expressing the President's \"frustration\" with the lack of progress toward peace in Ukraine, as he feels it \"hasn't reached what he expected at this stage.\" The source pointed to Trump envoy Steve Witkoff's three meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as numerous meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the conflict, which has lasted for more than three years, adding, \"Now is the time to get serious.\"",
