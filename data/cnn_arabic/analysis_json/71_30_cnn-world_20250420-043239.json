    "title_en": "US Customs: Smartphones and Computers Exempt from Trump's Tariffs",
    "text_summary_en": "The US Customs and Border Protection announced that imported electronic devices, including smartphones and computer components, would be exempt from tariffs previously imposed by former President Trump. This decision, effective from April 5th, follows the imposition of a 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Analysts view this as positive news for tech companies like Apple, which manufactures a significant portion of its products in China. The exemption could prevent price increases for consumers. While some companies have welcomed the news, others remain cautious, with Nintendo delaying pre-orders for its Switch 2 to assess the impact of tariffs and market conditions. Experts warn that the cost of tariffs could ultimately be passed on to consumers. Trump criticized the Biden administration's grant to TSMC, threatening high taxes if they don't build their factory in the US.",
