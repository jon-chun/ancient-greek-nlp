    "title_en": "\"No one will escape punishment\"... New statement by Trump on tariff exceptions",
    "text_summary_en": "President Trump clarified the US tariffs on high-tech products from China after a weekend of confusion. He stated that \"no one will escape punishment\" for unfair trade practices, especially China. Trump denied any tariff exemptions were announced, stating the products are subject to existing fentanyl tariffs, just moved to a different category. The Customs and Border Protection had issued a rule exempting some high-tech products from tariffs, which caused optimism in the tech sector. However, Trump administration officials claimed the exemption was temporary, part of a review of national security implications of semiconductor imports. New tariffs will be implemented after the review, which could take one to two months. Trump emphasized the need to manufacture products in the US to avoid being held hostage by other countries, particularly hostile trading partners like China.",
