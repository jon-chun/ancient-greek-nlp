    "title_en": "CNN Analysis: Why a US-China \"Decoupling\" Would Be a \"Messy Divorce\"?",
    "text_summary_en": "This CNN analysis discusses the potential \"divorce\" or decoupling between the US and China, highlighting the economic consequences and the lack of willingness from both sides to negotiate effectively. The article points out that trade between the two countries is expected to decline significantly, impacting global trade and various industries. It mentions specific examples like Boeing facing restrictions, China limiting exports of rare earth minerals, and Nvidia incurring losses. The article also notes the potential for increased prices for consumers and a warning from the Federal Reserve about the risks of tariffs leading to economic slowdown, unemployment, and inflation. The analysis suggests that the US might be aiming to weaken China's economy and is preparing to pressure other countries to reduce trade with China. China, having learned from past experiences, is now better equipped to retaliate and is trying to maintain a positive image with other trading partners.",
