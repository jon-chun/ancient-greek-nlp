    "text_summary_en": "Former US President Donald Trump acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin started the war against Ukraine but continued to blame Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and former US President Joe Biden. Trump stated that the war should not have started and that Biden and Zelensky could have stopped it. He also criticized Zelensky's request to purchase more Patriot missile systems, arguing that one should not start a war with someone significantly larger and then expect others to provide assistance. Trump characterized the war as \"Biden's war\" and claimed he is trying to stop it.",
