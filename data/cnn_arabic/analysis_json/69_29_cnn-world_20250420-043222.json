    "title_en": "British Government Takes Over Last Steel Plant Due to Chinese Owner's Decision",
    "text_summary_en": "The British government has effectively taken control of the last remaining British steel plant producing steel from scratch, after legislators approved an emergency rescue plan. Prime Minister Kir Starmer convened an extraordinary session to support a bill aimed at preventing Jingye Group, the Chinese owner of British Steel, from closing the two massive blast furnaces at its Scunthorpe plant. The bill grants the Minister of Business the authority to direct the company's board and workforce, ensuring workers are paid and raw materials are secured. Jingye Group claimed the Scunthorpe plant was losing a significant amount of money daily due to market conditions and environmental costs. The UK, formerly a global steel powerhouse, risked becoming the only G7 nation without the capacity to produce steel from scratch. The government criticized Jingye for making \"excessive\" demands and intervened to prevent the plant's closure. The future role of Jingye in the plant's daily operations remains unclear.",
