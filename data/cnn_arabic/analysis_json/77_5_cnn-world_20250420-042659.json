    "title_en": "Rubio Warns: America Should Abandon Its Efforts If the Ukraine War Does Not End",
    "text_summary_en": "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that if ending the war in Ukraine is not possible, the United States should abandon its efforts. Rubio emphasized that it is not America's war and that the U.S. has been assisting Ukraine for the past three years, desiring an end to the conflict. He mentioned President Trump's repeated attempts to end the war and the need for a decision on whether it is achievable. Rubio, along with Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, met with European and Ukrainian officials as part of Washington's efforts to mediate an end to the war. Rubio also spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, presenting the U.S. peace plan. He indicated that a decision needs to be made quickly regarding the feasibility of ending the war and that discussions are underway to determine what ending the war might entail. The U.S. State Department reported that the U.S. peace plan received an \"encouraging reception\" in the talks.",
