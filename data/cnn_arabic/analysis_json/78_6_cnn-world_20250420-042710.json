    "text_summary_en": "A shooting at Florida State University resulted in two deaths and five injuries, none of whom were students. The shooter was apprehended. Donald Trump described the shooting as \"shameful\" but stated he is unlikely to pursue changes to gun laws, reaffirming his support for the Second Amendment. He emphasized that \"shooting is not from the weapon, but from the people.\" During his presidency, Trump had previously considered expanding background checks for gun purchases but later retracted those considerations. During his 2024 campaign, Trump said the Second Amendment was under siege and praised the NRA's endorsement.",
