    "text_summary_en": "A tourist helicopter crashed into the Hudson River in New York, turning a family trip into a tragedy that killed six people, including children and their parents, who worked for the German company Siemens. The father, Agustin Escobar, was an executive at Siemens. The family was visiting from Spain. The helicopter took off from a Manhattan helipad and followed a familiar route, flying around the Statue of Liberty and then north along the Hudson River towards the George Washington Bridge before heading south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, it crashed into the water. The helicopter was not equipped with flight data recorders. The cause of the accident is still unclear. The helicopter took off at 2:59 PM and crashed at 3:17 PM. The weather was cloudy with winds between 10 and 15 miles per hour.",
