    "title_en": "\"Welcome to the Slave House\": Tesla Reaches Settlement with Black Employee Who Filed a Racial Discrimination Lawsuit",
    "text_summary_en": "Tesla has reached a settlement in a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by a Black employee. The employee, Rayna Pierce, alleged that a manager at the Fremont, California factory would sometimes greet workers with phrases like \"Welcome to the plantation\" or \"Welcome to the slave house.\" Pierce also claimed widespread harassment, including racial slurs written throughout the factory and gender-based insults. She stated she was disciplined for behavior that non-Black employees were excused for. The settlement was reached through mediation and the terms were not disclosed. Tesla has faced other accusations of racial discrimination and harassment at the Fremont factory, including a previous case where another employee, Owen Diaz, reached a settlement after a jury initially awarded him millions of dollars.",
