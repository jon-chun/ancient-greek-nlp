    "title_en": "China's Powerful Card in its Battle Against Trump's Trade War: What Is It?",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses China's dominance in the rare earth minerals supply chain and how it is being used as leverage in a renewed trade war with the United States. China controls a significant portion of both the mining and processing of these minerals, crucial for various technologies. The US, under Trump, has been trying to build its own domestic supply chain, but faces significant challenges. China's recent export controls have already disrupted shipments to American and European companies. While the US is investing in domestic production and sourcing from allies, it will take years to meet demand. Some American companies see this as an opportunity to accelerate domestic production. The article highlights the strategic importance of rare earth minerals and the challenges the US faces in reducing its dependence on China.",
