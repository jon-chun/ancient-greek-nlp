    "text_summary_en": "Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on Joe Biden, accusing him of allowing millions of \"killer immigrants\" and drug dealers to enter the United States through open and dangerous borders. Trump stated on his social media account that Biden, whom he describes as the \"worst president in US history,\" permitted criminals, including murderers, drug dealers, and individuals released from prisons and mental institutions, to enter the country. Trump defended his policy of deporting such individuals, stating that it was the reason he was elected. He also posted a picture of a deported individual allegedly belonging to the MS-13 gang, emphasizing the need to remove \"bad guys\" from the United States. He criticizes Democrats for wanting to allow such individuals back into the country, despite evidence of their criminal activity.",
