    "title_en": "CNN Analysis: What is Ukraine's Goal in Presenting Chinese Nationals \"Captured Fighting for Russia\" in a Press Conference?",
    "text_summary_en": "The article analyzes Ukraine's decision to present captured Chinese nationals fighting for Russia in a press conference, despite potential violations of international humanitarian law. Ukraine likely aimed to highlight China's potential involvement in the conflict, given Beijing's claims of neutrality and repeated calls for its citizens not to engage in foreign conflicts. The captured individuals claimed financial incentives motivated their involvement, contradicting Beijing's stance. The article also discusses the broader issue of foreign fighters on both sides of the conflict, noting the presence of individuals from various countries. The timing of the press conference is significant, coinciding with Kyiv's efforts to influence US policy and EU-China relations, suggesting Ukraine seeks to amplify concerns about China's support for Russia. Beijing has criticized the move, urging responsible understanding of China's role.",
