    "text_summary_en": "Former US President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's second term, calling the administration's handling of the Social Security Administration \"devastating.\" Speaking at the National Conference of Defenders, Advisors, and Representatives for People with Disabilities (ACRD) in Chicago, Biden condemned Republican policies and defended entitlement programs. He warned against cuts to Social Security and accused the current administration of \"interfering\" in its affairs, referring to a massive reorganization led by Elon Musk's government efficiency administration, including staff reductions and policy changes. Biden criticized the \"emerging technology companies\" approach of the new administration, accusing them of \"breaking things\" and causing \"unjustified pain.\" He also criticized the \"30%\" of the country he described as \"heartless.\" The Social Security Administration responded, accusing Biden of \"lying\" and claiming Trump promised to protect Social Security. Biden also joked about his age and the issue of social security fraud. He mentioned his role in the Americans with Disabilities Act.",
