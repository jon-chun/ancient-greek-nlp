    "title_en": "After Trump's Decision: Harvard President Rejects \"Dictations\" and Columbia University Increases Support for International Students",
    "text_summary_en": "Tensions have escalated between the Trump administration and Harvard University after the administration announced it would freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts due to Harvard's refusal to comply with the administration's demands to change its policies. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated that no government should dictate what private universities can teach, who they can admit or employ, or what areas of study and research they can pursue. This follows investigations into universities nationwide regarding concerns about antisemitism or racial preferences. Meanwhile, Columbia University announced new initiatives to increase support for international students, including a new \"International Student Hardship Fund\" and expanded resources at the International Students and Scholars Office, acknowledging the financial distress many international students face due to the Trump administration's policies on immigration. Columbia is in \"good faith discussions\" to restore federal funding, but considers \"unduly prescriptive demands\" regarding diversity as \"non-negotiable.\"",
