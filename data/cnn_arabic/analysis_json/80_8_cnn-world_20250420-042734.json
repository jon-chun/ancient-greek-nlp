    "title_en": "China Retains a Strategic Card in its Trade Conflict with Trump",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses China's dominance in the rare earth minerals supply chain and how it's being used as a strategic tool in its trade conflict with the United States. China controls a significant portion of both the mining and processing of these minerals, which are crucial for various advanced technologies. In response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, China has implemented export restrictions on certain rare earth minerals, requiring government permission for export. The US is attempting to build its own domestic supply chain, but this will take time. The article highlights the potential impact of China's strategy on American industries and national security, as well as the US's efforts to reduce its reliance on Chinese supplies.",
