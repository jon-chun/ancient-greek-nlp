    "title_en": "How Will Trump's Trade War Against China Negatively Affect American Farmers?",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the potential negative impact of Donald Trump's trade policies, specifically increased tariffs on Chinese imports, on American farmers. China is retaliating with its own tariffs on US goods, particularly agricultural products like soybeans. This is reminiscent of a previous trade war where China diversified its import sources, benefiting countries like Brazil. The article highlights the significant reliance of American farmers on exports to China and the potential economic losses they face due to these trade tensions. It also mentions China seeking alternative trade partners and the political implications for Trump, given that many affected farmers are in states that voted for him. The article concludes by noting China's efforts to strengthen trade relations with other countries and regions, such as ASEAN and the EU, to counter the impact of US tariffs.",
