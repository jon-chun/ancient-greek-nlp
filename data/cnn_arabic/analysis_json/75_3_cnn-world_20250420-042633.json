    "title_en": "\"Crimea for a War Ceasefire\"... Source Reveals to CNN a Proposal Presented by America to Russia Regarding Ukraine",
    "text_summary_en": "A source revealed to CNN that the Trump administration is prepared to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea as part of a US proposal to end the war in Ukraine. The proposal would also establish a ceasefire along the front lines. European and Ukrainian officials were briefed on the framework in Paris, while Russian officials were informed via a phone call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Some aspects of the framework still need to be finalized, and the US intends to collaborate with European and Ukrainian officials in London next week. Simultaneously, the US administration plans another meeting between Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian officials to persuade Moscow to accept the framework. Trump stated he's ready to abandon mediating a peace deal if the parties can't reach an agreement quickly, echoing his Secretary of State's warning to withdraw from mediation if a deal isn't reached within days.",
