    "text_summary_en": "Donald Trump's second term began with a series of executive orders signed in his first weeks, with promises of more to come. Trump pledged to enact a comprehensive agenda and restructure the federal government, stating in his inauguration speech that \"the golden age of America\" had begun. He outlined priorities such as immigration, trade, and national security. The article aims to inform the reader about Trump's actions in office, without explicitly stating whether these actions are positive or negative. Therefore, the overall sentiment is neutral.",
