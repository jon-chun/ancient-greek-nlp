    "text_summary_en": "Former President Donald Trump commented on the Russian attack on Sumy, Ukraine, which resulted in at least 34 deaths. Trump stated he was told Russia \"made a mistake\" and described the attack as \"horrific\" and the war as a \"disgrace.\" He reiterated his claim that the war wouldn't have started if he were president and blamed President Biden for the conflict. The attack involved Russian missiles striking civilians gathered for prayers at a church in Sumy. Trump also mentioned meeting with his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who recently met with Vladimir Putin and Iranian officials. He indicated that discussions regarding Iran are ongoing and a decision will be made soon.",
