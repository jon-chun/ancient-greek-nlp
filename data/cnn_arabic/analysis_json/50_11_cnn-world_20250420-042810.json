    "title_en": "A Glimpse into Trump's Implemented and Potential Tariff Policies",
    "text_summary_en": "Democratic state treasurers from Colorado, Washington, California, New Mexico, and Illinois expressed deep concern about the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war on farmers and the agricultural sector during a press call with \"Americans for Responsible Growth.\" Colorado Treasurer Dave Young warned that Trump's trade war could lead to the closure of small and large production facilities across the country. Minnesota State Auditor Julie Blaha noted farmers' anxieties regarding the uncertainty created by the administration's tariff policies and the potential loss of Chinese customers to competitors like Brazil. Blaha also questioned the adequacy of potential government assistance to offset the negative effects of the tariffs, suggesting that the 2018 bailout was insufficient and a comprehensive plan is needed. The article then introduces a look at Trump's existing and potential future tariff policies.",
