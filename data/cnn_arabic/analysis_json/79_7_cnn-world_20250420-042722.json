    "title_en": "Kremlin Reveals Putin Sent Message to Trump Regarding Ukraine",
    "text_summary_en": "The Kremlin announced that U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff delivered a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin to President Donald Trump ahead of Ukraine talks in Paris. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov expressed hope that the talks between the Ukrainian delegation and U.S. representatives in France would focus on finding a peaceful resolution. Peskov stated that Trump was informed of the conversation's content. He also accused Europe of focusing on prolonging the war and expressed hope for more movement towards a peaceful settlement from European and Ukrainian sides. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff are scheduled to meet with Ukrainian officials in Paris to bolster Ukraine's defenses against the ongoing Russian invasion. While Trump's promise to end the war in a day seems unlikely, the hope for a complete truce by Easter is also fading as Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine despite Washington's initiatives towards Moscow.",
