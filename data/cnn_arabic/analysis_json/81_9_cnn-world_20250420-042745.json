    "title_en": "Chinese Factories Take Trade War with America to a New Place",
    "text_summary_en": "Chinese suppliers are using American social media to encourage users to bypass tariffs imposed by the US on Beijing by buying directly from factories. A TikTok user claimed to manufacture original equipment for luxury brands, while apps like DHgate and Taobao gained popularity in the US. Experts doubt the authenticity of these claims, citing non-disclosure agreements. The videos highlight consumer concerns about tariffs and dependence on China. These Chinese producers are promoting the message that the economic policies of the White House will deprive the American consumer of access to his favorite products or pay more to obtain them. Lululemon denied claims that its products are sourced from specific factories mentioned in the videos. Experts suggest that any factory directly soliciting US consumers is likely unauthorized and could be selling counterfeits. The article also discusses the environmental impact of increased direct purchasing from Chinese manufacturers and the potential end of a tax exemption on low-value packages.",
