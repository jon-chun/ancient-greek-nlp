    "text_summary_en": "A White House physician's memo stated that Donald Trump is \"completely fit\" to perform the duties of the presidency after his annual physical. The memo detailed lab tests, physical exams, and a cognitive test, concluding Trump is in excellent health. His weight is 224 pounds (101.6 kg), height is 75 inches (190 cm), resting heart rate is 62 bpm, and blood pressure is 128/74 mmHg. He scored 30/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Physical exams of various bodily systems were normal. The doctor noted scars from an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last year. A colonoscopy revealed diverticulitis. Trump also underwent cataract surgery at some point. The memo concludes Trump is in excellent cognitive and physical health and fit to perform his duties.",
