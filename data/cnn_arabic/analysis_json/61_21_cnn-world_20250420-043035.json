    "title_en": "Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion in Funding for Harvard After University Rejects Request",
    "text_summary_en": "The Trump administration announced it would freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts allocated to Harvard University after the university refused to comply with the administration's demands to change its policies. Harvard responded by reiterating its refusal to comply, arguing that withdrawing funding would endanger public health, welfare, economic security, and national vitality. The administration's demands included eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, banning masks at campus protests, implementing merit-based hiring and admissions, and reducing the power of faculty deemed more activist than scholarly. These demands are part of a broader effort to combat antisemitism on campuses following events related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. The White House stated that taxpayer money should not fund racial discrimination or violence. Harvard's president argued that the government shouldn't dictate what universities teach, who they admit or hire, or what research they pursue. A Harvard faculty association filed a lawsuit against the administration to prevent the funding cuts, citing violations of academic freedom and free speech.",
