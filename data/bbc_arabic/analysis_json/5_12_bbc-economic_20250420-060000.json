    "title_en": "Trump Suspends Additional Tariffs for 90 Days, Says He's Open to Talks with China After Raising Tariffs to 125 Percent",
    "text_summary_en": "US President Donald Trump announced a temporary 90-day halt to tariff increases on dozens of countries, but raised tariffs on China to 125 percent. Trump cited China's \"disrespect for global markets\" as the reason for the increase. He also stated his willingness to negotiate with countries that are open to it. Following the announcement, Wall Street experienced a significant rebound. Other countries and organizations reacted to the news, including the WTO, whose director warned of the potential damage to the global economy from the US-China trade dispute. Several world leaders commented on Trump's decision, including the new German Chancellor, the Italian Minister of Economy, and the interim President of Bangladesh. Latin American leaders also pledged to boost trade within the region to mitigate the impact of Trump's tariffs.",
