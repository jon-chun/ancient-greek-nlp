    "text_summary_en": "Egyptian authorities have closed several food and sweets stores, including the popular \"Balaben,\" due to food safety concerns and reported cases of food poisoning. The National Food Safety Authority cited complaints and found pathogenic bacteria and banned food coloring in samples taken from various branches. While Balaben initially attributed the closures to administrative issues, they later acknowledged struggling to resolve the situation with authorities. The closures followed similar actions in Saudi Arabia due to poisoning complaints. The decision has sparked widespread reactions, with some supporting the government's action to protect public health, while others express concern over the job losses resulting from the closures, with Balaben claiming over 25,000 workers are affected. Some users also questioned the ownership of Balaben, alleging the owner is not Egyptian and owns other closed restaurants.",
