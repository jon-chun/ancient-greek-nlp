    "text_summary_en": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi stated that \"relative progress in the principles and objectives of a possible agreement\" was made during nuclear talks with the US in Rome. While expressing cautious optimism, he noted that the JCPOA only offered \"lessons learned,\" and expert-level negotiations would begin soon to formulate details. A US official confirmed \"very good progress\" in direct and indirect discussions mediated by Oman. Discussions were described as \"constructive,\" with Oman facilitating communication between the Iranian and US delegations. The parties agreed to move to the next phase of talks aimed at a \"fair, lasting, and binding agreement\" ensuring Iran's nuclear-free status, complete sanctions lifting, and the right to peaceful nuclear development. Future talks are planned in Muscat. Ali Shamkhani emphasized Iran's pursuit of an \"equitable agreement\" and rejection of the \"Libyan model.\" The article also mentions previous US sanctions, a message from Trump to Khamenei, and European calls for the \"snapback\" mechanism. Khamenei cautioned against relying too heavily on negotiations.",
