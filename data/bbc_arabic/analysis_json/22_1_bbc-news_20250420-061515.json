    "title_en": "Reuters Investigation Reveals Details of Assad's Wealth Smuggling on a Private Plane to the UAE",
    "text_summary_en": "A Reuters investigation details how former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad smuggled funds and valuables on a private plane to the UAE in the 48 hours before his regime's collapse, along with secret documents related to his business network. Assad's economic advisor, Yassar Ibrahim, played a key role in chartering the plane, which made four flights transporting assets belonging to Assad, his family, aides, and presidential staff. The report highlights Ibrahim's role in establishing a business network used by Assad to dominate the Syrian economy. The plane, an Embraer Legacy 600, made four consecutive flights to Syria before Assad's ouster. The investigation involved interviews with Syrian sources, including airport staff, former intelligence officers, and a source connected to Assad's business network. The plane carried cash, documents, and hard drives containing sensitive intelligence. The Syrian transitional government intends to recover the funds transferred abroad.",
