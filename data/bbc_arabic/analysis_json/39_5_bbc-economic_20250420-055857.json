    "title_en": "\"This is very difficult\": Small Chinese companies stop working due to Trump's tariffs",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the impact of tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump on small Chinese businesses. Many companies that relied heavily on exports to the United States, particularly those selling products through retailers like Walmart, have been severely affected. Some have been forced to halt production and store goods in warehouses, hoping for a reversal of the tariffs. The tariffs have created uncertainty and anxiety among business owners, who fear for the future of their factories. While China has vowed to withstand the trade war, some workers are already experiencing hardship, with reduced wages and difficulty finding employment. The article also touches on China's efforts to boost domestic consumption, which have been hampered by economic factors. Some companies are exploring new markets in Europe, Saudi Arabia, and Russia to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. Economists warn that the trade war could lead to a recession in the United States.",
