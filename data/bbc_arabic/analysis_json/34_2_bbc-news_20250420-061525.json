    "title_en": "American Design and Chinese Manufacturing: How Apple Got Caught in the Heart of the Conflict?",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses Apple's reliance on China for manufacturing its products, particularly iPhones, and how this dependence has placed the company in the middle of the trade conflict between the US and China. Despite designing its products in California, Apple manufactures a significant portion of its devices and components in China. Former US President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports have created uncertainty for Apple, even though some electronics were temporarily exempted. The article explores the intertwined relationship between the US and Chinese economies, highlighting how China has benefited from hosting Apple's assembly lines. While Apple has begun to diversify its supply chain to countries like Vietnam and India, China remains a crucial manufacturing hub. The article also touches on the increasing competition Apple faces from Chinese companies and the challenges it faces in the Chinese market due to government regulations and economic factors. The future remains uncertain for Apple as it navigates the complex geopolitical landscape.",
