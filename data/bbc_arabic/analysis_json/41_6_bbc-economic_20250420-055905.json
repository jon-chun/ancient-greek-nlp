    "title_en": "Sony Raises Prices After Trump Denies Exempting Some Electronics from China from Tariffs",
    "text_summary_en": "President Trump stated that smartphones and other electronics made in China would not be exempt from tariffs, placing them in a different tariff category. European stock markets rose initially following an earlier announcement that some products might be exempt from tariffs up to 145%, but this was later contradicted. China urged the US to completely remove tariffs and return to mutual respect. The US clarified that these products would instead be subject to \"semiconductor tariffs.\" Sony announced a price increase of nearly 10% for its PlayStation 5 in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, citing a difficult economic environment, inflation, and exchange rate fluctuations. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce called the initially announced exemptions a \"small step,\" while officials in the Trump administration suggest future tariffs, potentially hindering a resolution between the US and China. Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic to improve trade agreements and bring manufacturing back to the US, but they also cause market instability and raise concerns about global trade decline.",
