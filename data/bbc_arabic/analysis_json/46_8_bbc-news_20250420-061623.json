    "title_en": "\"If criticizing mass immigration can get you banned from Britain, freedom of expression is dead\" â€“ The Telegraph",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses concerns about freedom of expression in Britain after a French writer, Renaud Camus, was banned from entering the country due to his views on immigration. The piece contrasts this action with Prime Minister Starmer's assurances about free speech. It highlights Camus's controversial book \"The Great Replacement\" and questions whether expressing such views should warrant a ban. The article also touches on Donald Trump's first 100 days of his second term, describing them as a \"historic failure,\" citing legislative inaction, economic decline, and foreign policy missteps. Finally, it explores the role of AI in enhancing occupational health and safety, focusing on predictive risk analysis, virtual reality training, and wearable technology. The article emphasizes the need for organizations to embrace a culture of innovation and change to effectively leverage these technologies.",
