    "text_summary_en": "The US, under President Trump, threatens to withdraw from mediating peace talks between Ukraine and Russia if no progress is made. Secretary of State Rubio warns of other priorities. The backdrop is continued Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities, with casualties reported. Russia has set conditions for a ceasefire, and while the US initially expressed confidence in securing a quick agreement, a full ceasefire hasn't been achieved. The US blames both sides. A potential deal involving Ukrainian minerals and infrastructure is under discussion, but faces resistance and complexities. Zelenskyy seeks security guarantees in any ceasefire agreement. A memorandum of intent for an investment fund has been signed. Discussions continue at various levels, including meetings between US and Ukrainian officials in Paris.",
