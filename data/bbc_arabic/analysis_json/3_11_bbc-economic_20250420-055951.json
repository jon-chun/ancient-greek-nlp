    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses key economic terms that have gained prominence following Donald Trump's tariff announcements. It defines terms like \"stock market crash,\" explaining its causes and historical examples. It also explains \"bear market\" and \"bull market,\" relating them to market trends. The article further elaborates on \"economic recession\" and \"depression,\" detailing their characteristics and the historical \"Great Depression.\" It clarifies \"tariff,\" its purpose, and its impact on consumers and international trade, including the concept of \"reciprocal tariffs\" as promoted by Trump. The article concludes by noting that while tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, they can also lead to higher prices and hinder free competition. The article also references trade agreements like the EU customs union and NAFTA.",
