    "title_en": "What are Trump's Real Goals Behind Imposing Tariffs? - Washington Post",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the global reaction to the tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump and the potential for a trade war. The Washington Post attempts to understand the reasons behind the decision, finding the justifications \"weak.\" The article highlights the impact of these tariffs on various countries, including African nations like Lesotho, which relies heavily on exports to the US. It also mentions the effect on Russia, whose stock market suffered losses despite being excluded from the tariffs. The article suggests that the tariffs could push African countries towards greater dependence on China and that Russia might face financial difficulties due to falling oil prices. Overall, the article conveys a sense of concern and uncertainty regarding the economic consequences of Trump's trade policies.",
