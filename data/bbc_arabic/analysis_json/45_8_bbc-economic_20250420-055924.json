    "title_en": "Why is Egypt raising gasoline prices despite the global decline? - Controversy on social media platforms",
    "text_summary_en": "The Egyptian government has decided to increase gasoline and petroleum product prices starting Friday, the first increase in 2025 and the second in 6 months. This increase was expected as part of the government's plan to fully remove fuel subsidies and align prices with global rates, in accordance with its economic reform program and agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The government aims to eliminate fuel subsidies by the end of 2025, except for diesel and gas cylinders. Fuel subsidies cost Egypt approximately 11 billion Egyptian pounds monthly. The price increase sparked widespread anger on social media, with users noting the contrast with global oil price declines. The increase was two Egyptian pounds per liter for various types of gasoline and diesel. The Ministry of Petroleum stated that despite the increases, a price gap remains due to high costs, and the government is considering the social impact. Social media users expressed concerns about the increased burden on citizens, as fuel price hikes typically lead to higher prices for other goods and services. Inflation has already risen, and transportation fares have increased following the announcement. Since President Sisi took office, fuel prices have been adjusted over 20 times, and an automatic pricing mechanism was introduced in 2019.",
