    "text_summary_en": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel is in a \"crucial stage of the battle\" in Gaza and vowed to retrieve all hostages without succumbing to Hamas' demands. He claimed Hamas rejected a proposal to release half the living hostages, demanding a ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu asserted that yielding to Hamas would nullify Israel's achievements and threaten national security. These statements coincided with large protests in Tel Aviv demanding a hostage release deal. The Israeli army reported its first soldier death in northern Gaza since resuming operations in mid-March. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed at least 54 people in Gaza, according to the Civil Defense. The UN reports a dire humanitarian crisis with limited aid entering Gaza, leading to increased malnutrition among children. Hamas accuses Israel of using starvation as a weapon, while Israel insists aid restrictions are necessary to pressure Hamas. Hamas also announced the fate of American-Israeli hostage, Eidan Aleksander, is unknown after a recent Israeli strike. Turkish intelligence met with Hamas leaders to discuss aid delivery to Gaza.",
