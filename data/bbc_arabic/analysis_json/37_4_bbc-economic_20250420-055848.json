    "title_en": "What Does Trump Want from Canada?",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the escalating tensions between the United States and Canada following Donald Trump's return to the White House. A long-standing dispute over the \"Gray Zone\" near Machias Seal Island, a valuable lobster fishing area, highlights the potential for conflict. Trump's rhetoric about annexing Canada, imposing tariffs, and exploiting Canadian resources has raised concerns among Canadian leaders. The article explores the potential motivations behind Trump's actions, including a desire to control resources and reshape the US's role in the world. Some analysts suggest Trump's focus is on building a regional fortress, while others believe his actions are driven by a lack of coherent strategy. The article concludes that Trump's policies are damaging the relationship between the two countries, with potential for unforeseen consequences.",
