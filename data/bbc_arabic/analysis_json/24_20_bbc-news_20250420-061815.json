    "text_summary_en": "General Mohammed al-Maqdashi, military advisor to the Presidential Leadership Council in Yemen, stated that the American strikes against the Houthis in Yemen achieved several goals, including the destruction of weapons and equipment, and the killing of a number of Houthi leaders. Regarding a potential military operation by the legitimate government forces against the Houthis, al-Maqdashi emphasized that military operations are usually planned secretly and are surprising, casting doubt on reports from unnamed Yemeni military sources. He believes the Houthis will be defeated with regional or American support, pointing to the starvation and humiliation they have inflicted on Yemenis, arguing they exploit the Palestinian cause despite all Yemenis supporting Palestine. Regarding alleged weapons smuggling from Oman to the Houthis, al-Maqdashi said they have information but no confirmed evidence, questioning Oman's potential involvement. The article previews an episode of the \"No Restrictions\" program that will discuss the situation of Yemeni forces, coordination between them, the current truce, and civilian casualties from American strikes. The episode will air on Saturday at 5:30 PM GMT.",
