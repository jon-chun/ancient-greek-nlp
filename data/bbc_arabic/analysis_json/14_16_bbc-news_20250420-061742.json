    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the implications of a meeting between Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Syrian transitional leader Ahmed al-Shara, mediated by the Emir of Qatar. The meeting, initially intended to be unannounced due to opposition within Iraq to normalizing relations with the Syrian government, aimed to gauge al-Shara's stance. The leak of the meeting's photo caused embarrassment for the Iraqi government, which had not officially announced it. The meeting occurred before the upcoming Arab League summit in Iraq and follows calls from Qatar for reconciliation between Syria and Iraq. The article highlights the complex history between Iraq and Syria, including past tensions and recent cooperation against ISIS. It also emphasizes Iraq's growing role in regional stability and the potential benefits of normalized relations for both countries, particularly in security and energy. The article notes that there are differing opinions on the meeting, with some fearing internal and regional pressures that could hinder improved relations.",
