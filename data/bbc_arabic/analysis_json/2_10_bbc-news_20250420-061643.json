    "text_summary_en": "A doctor in Gaza describes the dire state of the healthcare system after 18 months of conflict. Due to fuel shortages, she walks 50 minutes to reach her clinic. Only 21 of 36 hospitals are partially functioning, and medical supplies are severely limited due to the ongoing Israeli blockade. The clinic, a converted office after the original was targeted, sees around 150 patients daily, mostly displaced people living in shelters or on the streets. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant, especially among the elderly, young, and infants. The doctor highlights the lack of essential medicines, including insulin and epilepsy treatments, and the increasing cases of severe burns due to the shortage of cooking gas. The Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, a key medical center, was damaged by Israeli shelling, further crippling the healthcare system. The doctor expresses her frustration and despair, struggling to provide care with limited resources and facing a constant influx of patients. She worries about providing for her children and the lack of hope for an end to the conflict.",
