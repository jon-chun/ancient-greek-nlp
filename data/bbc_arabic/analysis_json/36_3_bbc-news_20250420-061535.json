    "title_en": "Russian Attacks on Ukraine \"Continue\" Despite Putin's Announcement of an \"Easter Truce\"",
    "text_summary_en": "Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a 30-hour \"Easter truce\" in Ukraine, ordering his forces to halt military activities until the end of Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated his country would adhere to the truce if Russia did, while accusing Moscow of already violating it. Zelenskyy highlighted ongoing fighting in the Russian regions of Kursk and Belgorod and the continued use of Russian drones. He also indicated Ukraine's willingness to extend the truce, referencing a previous US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha expressed skepticism, citing a history of Putin's words not matching his actions. The British Foreign Office urged Putin to demonstrate genuine commitment to peace by ending the invasion and adhering to a full ceasefire. The US is engaged in direct talks with Russia to end the war, but progress has been limited. Former US President Trump warned that the US might withdraw from mediating if progress isn't made quickly.",
