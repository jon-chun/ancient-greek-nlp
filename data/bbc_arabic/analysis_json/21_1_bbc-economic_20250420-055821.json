    "title_en": "How Egyptians Reacted to the Authorities' Decision to Close Famous Food and Dessert Shops",
    "text_summary_en": "Egyptian authorities have closed several food and dessert shops, including the popular \"Balaben,\" due to food safety concerns and violations. The closures followed reports of food poisoning and inspections revealing bacteria and unsafe practices. While authorities cited health risks, \"Balaben\" initially claimed the closures were due to administrative reasons, later admitting to struggling to understand and rectify the issues. The closures have sparked widespread debate, with some supporting the government's actions to protect public health, while others express concern over job losses, as \"Balaben\" claims the shutdown affects over 25,000 workers. The situation is further complicated by reports that the owner of \"Balaben\" is not Egyptian and owns other establishments that have also been closed. The incident echoes a similar situation in Saudi Arabia, where \"Balaben\" branches were also shut down due to food poisoning concerns.",
