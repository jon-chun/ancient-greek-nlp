    "title_en": "Trump Exempts Smartphones and Computers from New Tariffs",
    "text_summary_en": "The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and some other electronic devices from reciprocal tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports, which had reached 125%. This decision follows concerns from American tech companies about potentially significant price increases due to most devices being manufactured in China. This exemption is considered a major reversal of Trump's tariff policy on China. Other electronic components like semiconductors and solar cells are also included in the exemptions, but remain subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl smuggling. Analysts suggest the move allows companies like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft to breathe a sigh of relief. The White House stated the exemptions aim to provide companies more time to relocate production to the US, emphasizing the need to reduce reliance on China for vital technologies. Apple, for example, sells over half its smartphones in the US, with around 80% manufactured in China. The article also mentions Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain by increasing production in India and Vietnam.",
