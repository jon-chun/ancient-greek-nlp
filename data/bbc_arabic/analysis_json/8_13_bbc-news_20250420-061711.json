    "title_en": "What is the Shape of Relations Between the Gulf States and Syria After Assad?",
    "text_summary_en": "Following Ahmed al-Shara's assumption of the presidency in Syria for a transitional period, a new chapter has opened in its foreign relations, particularly with the Gulf states. This relationship is characterized by unprecedented meetings between the Syrian president and Gulf leaders, signaling a rapid improvement in political, economic, and Arab cooperation, driven by shared interests. Analysts note that this positive shift contrasts sharply with the strained relations during the Assad era. The article highlights key events such as the Qatari-Syrian meeting in Damascus and al-Shara's visit to Riyadh. While political engagement has increased, economic support for reconstruction is contingent on regional stability, influenced by factors like the Israeli-Gaza conflict and the Iranian nuclear file. The Saudi-Iranian rapprochement plays a role, aiming to neutralize Syria and reintegrate it into the Arab sphere. Analysts believe this rapprochement is a strategic move to foster regional stability and curb Iranian influence, while Syria's new leadership is seen as pragmatic and open to cooperation.",
