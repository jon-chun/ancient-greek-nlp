    "title_en": "Commentators React to the UAE's Decision to Ban Non-Emiratis from Speaking in the Local Dialect in Official Media",
    "text_summary_en": "The UAE has recently implemented a policy restricting the use of the Emirati dialect in official media to Emirati citizens only, who must also wear national dress when discussing projects or content in the local dialect. The policy aims to protect the national identity, prevent cultural symbol distortion, and combat the \"distortion of the Emirati dialect.\" While many citizens welcomed the decision as a step towards preserving heritage, some, especially non-Emirati media professionals, expressed concerns about its impact on cultural diversity and creative expression. Some commentators worry about how the policy will be enforced given the diverse population and dialect variations within the UAE. Others defended the policy as a means of safeguarding national identity. The decision stems from concerns about inaccurate and \"hybrid\" linguistic patterns presented as Emirati. Some non-Emirati media professionals who are proficient in the Emirati dialect fear losing their jobs. The policy's long-term impact on the media landscape remains to be seen.",
