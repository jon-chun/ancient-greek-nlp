    "title_en": "Fears of Trump's Tariffs Deal a Blow to the Saudi Economy: \"The Biggest in 5 Years\"",
    "text_summary_en": "The Saudi financial market experienced its biggest hit in 5 years following US President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on Saudi Arabian exports. The Saudi stock exchange fell by 6.78%, its largest drop since the COVID pandemic, triggering investor panic. The Saudi stock index lost approximately 800 points. While there was a partial recovery on Monday, several sectors, including public utilities, banking, telecommunications, and energy, experienced significant declines. Saudi Aramco's stock also fell. The tariffs, reportedly 10% on Saudi products, prompted declines in European and Asian stock markets as well. Experts suggest the tariffs are impacting the Saudi economy, with market losses exceeding 540 billion riyals. Some analysts view the tariffs as a tool for fair trade and potentially negotiable, while others anticipate retaliatory measures from Saudi Arabia. Despite the challenges, some see opportunities for strengthened trade relations and investment. The Saudi economy, the largest in the Arab world, is pursuing diversification under its \"Vision 2030\" plan.",
