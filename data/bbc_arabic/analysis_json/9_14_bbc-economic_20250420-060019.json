    "title_en": "Why China Thinks It Will Win the Trade War with Trump - The Economist",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the potential trade war between the US and China, sparked by increased tariffs imposed by the US. It examines China's perspective, as presented by The Economist, suggesting that China believes it can win this trade war. China's confidence stems from the US's need for China's cooperation on issues like fentanyl and the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as Trump's reluctance to ban TikTok. The article also explores potential retaliatory measures China could take, such as halting cooperation on fentanyl and restricting imports of US agricultural products. Other sources, like Gordon Chang in The Telegraph, argue that Trump's actions have severely damaged the Chinese economy, while Axios reports on increased tariffs on packages from Shein and Temu. The article presents a multifaceted view of the potential economic conflict and its possible consequences.",
