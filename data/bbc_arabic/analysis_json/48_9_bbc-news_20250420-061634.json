    "text_summary_en": "Finland has been ranked as the happiest country in the world for the eighth consecutive year. The article explores the reasons behind this ranking, highlighting the Finnish values of balance, harmony with nature, and simple contentment. While the Finns themselves react with a degree of surprise to the ranking, Finnish tourism companies are capitalizing on the growing interest in experiencing \"Finnish happiness.\" The article emphasizes that Finnish happiness is not about constant laughter but about contentment, satisfaction, and a sense of well-being derived from a balanced lifestyle. It discusses aspects of Finnish culture like the sauna, cuisine, design, and the \"right of every person\" to access nature. The article also touches upon the Finnish concept of \"sisu,\" or resilience, and the importance of a strong welfare system. While acknowledging potential challenges like long winters and economic pressures, the article concludes that Finland's high ranking is rooted in its culture, values, and accessible resources.",
