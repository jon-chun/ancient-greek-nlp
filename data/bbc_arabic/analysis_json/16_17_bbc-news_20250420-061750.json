    "text_summary_en": "In an attempt to contain the anger, Tunisian President Kais Saied visited the Al-Mazouna area on Friday morning, which witnessed protests after the death of 3 students and the injury of two others due to the collapse of their high school wall. Al-Mazouna is located in the Sidi Bouzid governorate, the birthplace of the Tunisian revolution and the spark that launched the movement against marginalization and corruption more than 10 years ago. The incident sparked widespread outrage on social media, with some condemning the deterioration of infrastructure, especially in educational and health institutions. Others criticized the \"continued adoption of policies that perpetuate centralization and marginalize the internal states.\" You can watch daily episodes of the program at 3:00 PM GMT, from Monday to Friday, and you can also view trending stories by clicking here.",
