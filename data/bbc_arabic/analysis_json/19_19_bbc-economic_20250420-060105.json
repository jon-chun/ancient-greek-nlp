    "title_en": "Decline Due to Tariffs and Rise Fueled by Rumors: Sharp Fluctuations in US Stock Markets",
    "text_summary_en": "US stocks recovered some losses on Monday, as investors hoped President Trump would shift from tariffs to trade agreements. The S&P 500 closed down about 0.2% after a volatile trading day, experiencing some of the most significant fluctuations since the COVID-19 pandemic. This occurred despite Trump's continued tariff threats against China and his announcement of upcoming trade negotiations with Japan and other countries. Trump sent mixed signals regarding the permanence of these tariffs. The market was negatively affected by Trump's announcement, with US and UK stock markets experiencing their worst daily declines since 2020. The S&P 500 lost over 10% of its value in three days, a sharp drop comparable to the 2008 financial crisis and the start of the pandemic. Market analysts expressed concern about the impact of tariffs on the US and global economy. Rumors about the White House considering suspending tariffs briefly boosted stocks. European and Asian markets also experienced declines.",
