    "text_summary_en": "The emigration of Egyptian doctors has escalated into a notable crisis, prompting parliamentary calls for strict measures to compel them to work within the country for five years before considering emigration. This has sparked widespread debate, intensified by statements from Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa that the emigration of doctors abroad generates financial and economic returns for the Egyptian state and that this is part of the state's policy and that there is a vision to double the number of medical graduates due to increasing demand.
