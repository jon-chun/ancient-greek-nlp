    "text_summary_en": "Thousands of protesters gathered in several American cities to express their rejection of President Donald Trump's policies, in what was considered the largest wave of protests since he took office. The \"Hands Off\" protests were planned in approximately 1200 locations across all fifty US states. Demonstrators protested Trump's policies on social issues, economic matters, and foreign policy, including tariffs on imports. Solidarity protests also took place outside the US, including in London, Paris, and Berlin. Protesters criticized Trump's \"authoritarian style of governance,\" including the dismissal of federal employees and the dismantling of the Department of Education. Trump's foreign policy also drew criticism, with some protesters carrying Ukrainian flags and others holding signs saying \"Free Palestine.\" The role of wealthy donors, particularly Elon Musk, in the Trump administration was also criticized. Polls show a slight decline in Trump's approval rating.",
