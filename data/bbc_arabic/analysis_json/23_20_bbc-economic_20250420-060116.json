    "title_en": "Worst Drop in Years: Financial Market Turmoil Begins Trading After Tariffs, Trump Comments: \"It's the Medicine\"",
    "text_summary_en": "Global financial markets experienced one of the worst drops since the coronavirus pandemic, triggered by US President Donald Trump's announcement of widespread tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, which he described as necessary \"medicine\" to address financial imbalances. Asian markets opened sharply lower, with significant losses in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. The tariffs, set at 10% for many countries and higher for specific ones, prompted retaliatory measures from China, including tariffs and export restrictions. Goldman Sachs predicted a slowdown in China's GDP growth due to the tariffs. Other countries, including New Zealand, India, and Saudi Arabia, also experienced market declines. The US Federal Reserve was expected to potentially cut interest rates to mitigate recession risks. Billionaire Bill Ackman criticized the tariffs, while Peter Navarro tried to reassure markets. Numerous countries sought negotiations with the US. Israel, Taiwan, India, and Italy responded with various strategies. The UK Prime Minister warned of the end of the existing trade system. Russia was notably excluded from the tariffs, possibly due to ongoing negotiations regarding Ukraine.",
