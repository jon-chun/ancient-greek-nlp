    "text_summary_en": "The Israeli army announced it targeted approximately 40 locations in airstrikes on the Gaza Strip. This followed Hamas's rejection of a new Israeli truce proposal, calling for an agreement leading to a complete cessation of hostilities. Palestinian sources reported 43 deaths due to the airstrikes. The situation in Gaza is dire, with shortages of food and medicine. The Israeli military is conducting operations in the Shaboura and Tel Sultan areas near Rafah, as well as in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Hamas rejected a temporary ceasefire proposal, insisting on a complete end to the war and Israeli withdrawal. Hamas also rejected \"partial truce deals\" and handing over weapons, stating its existence is tied to the Israeli occupation. International pressure is urged to end the Israeli blockade. The US criticized Hamas's stance. Israeli officials are calling for intensified military action against Hamas. The UN warns of deteriorating conditions and shortages in Gaza.",
