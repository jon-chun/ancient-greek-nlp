    "title_en": "The Great Depression: How the American Economic Crisis Changed the Course of the World?",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the parallels between current US protectionist policies under President Trump and the economic conditions leading to the Great Depression. It recounts the events of the 1929 stock market crash and its global impact, including bank failures, unemployment, and the rise of extremist ideologies in Europe. The article highlights the role of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in exacerbating the crisis and draws comparisons to Trump's current trade policies. It also discusses Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" as a response to the crisis and emphasizes the importance of trust in the economic system. The article concludes by warning that repeating past mistakes could lead to another global catastrophe, especially with the rise of new economic powers.",
