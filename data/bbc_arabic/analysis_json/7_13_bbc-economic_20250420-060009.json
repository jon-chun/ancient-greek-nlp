    "title_en": "China Responds to Trump's \"Trade Tyranny\" with 84 Percent Tariffs",
    "text_summary_en": "China has announced an 84% tariff on goods imported from the US in response to new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 104%. Beijing calls for global unity against Trump's tariffs, as Chinese exporters suffer. The article highlights the impact on Chinese businesses, with rising costs and shrinking profit margins. Some analysts predict that tariffs exceeding 35% will eliminate profits for Chinese companies exporting to the US or Southeast Asia. China is reportedly considering countermeasures like banning Hollywood films and suspending fentanyl cooperation. Businesses are adjusting supply chains, with some relocating production to countries like Indonesia, though even those exports now face tariffs. The tariffs are causing uncertainty and concern among businesses and economists, who warn of potential recession. The American Chamber of Commerce in China expressed concern that the tariffs will do more harm than good. Some analysts believe China will be forced to restructure its economy to rely more on domestic consumption.",
