    "title_en": "US Tariffs Imposed on About 60 Countries Come into Effect",
    "text_summary_en": "US President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on approximately 60 countries took effect. This is the final stage of Trump's comprehensive global tariff plan, which includes higher import taxes on countries he considers the \"worst abusers of trade.\" This phase includes a significant increase in tariffs on China, with some goods facing tariffs exceeding 100%. China accuses Trump of acting like a \"thug\" and refuses to eliminate retaliatory tariffs on the US. Trump stated his tariffs will be \"legendary, in a positive way.\" Global markets have lost trillions due to investor uncertainty. Asian markets declined, except for the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which opened slightly higher. China stated they \"do not stir up trouble, but do not fear it\" and will \"fight to the end\" while keeping the door open for dialogue. South Korea launched emergency support for its auto sector after the US imposed 25% tariffs, while Taiwan activated a $15 billion stabilization fund.",
