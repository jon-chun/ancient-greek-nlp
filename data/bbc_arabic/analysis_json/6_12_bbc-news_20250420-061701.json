    "title_en": "Threats and Conflicting Messages Precede Iranian Nuclear Talks: Where are Negotiations Heading?",
    "text_summary_en": "As Iran and the United States prepare for a second round of difficult nuclear talks in Rome, hopes for de-escalation are diminishing due to increasing military threats and conflicting messages. President Trump is reminding Tehran daily of the options of \"agreement or war,\" suggesting Israel might lead a military response if talks fail. Despite reports of Trump backing down from an Israeli plan to strike Iranian nuclear sites, he stated he prefers diplomacy. While both sides described the first round of talks in Oman as constructive, a final agreement remains distant. Key issues include Iran's uranium enrichment program and verification processes. Diplomatic activity is intensifying, with visits from Saudi and Iranian officials to Tehran, Moscow respectively. Iran warns of retaliation against US bases in the region in case of an attack. The article highlights the deep mistrust stemming from Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and Iran's internal pressures due to economic hardship and potential protests.",
