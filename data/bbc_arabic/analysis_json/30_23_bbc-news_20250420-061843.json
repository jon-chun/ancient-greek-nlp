    "text_summary_en": "Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani met with Syrian transitional President Ahmed al-Shara in Doha, Qatar, under the direct patronage of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The meeting, initially held away from the spotlight, quickly became public, sparking widespread questions and speculation about its content and timing, especially as it is the first of its kind since the ousting of the Assad regime and after months of political debate about opening up to Damascus. According to an official statement issued by the Syrian Presidency on Thursday evening, the meeting took place with Qatari mediation and discussed bilateral relations between Iraq and Syria, emphasizing the importance of reactivating joint Arab cooperation and stressing the deep historical ties that bind the two peoples.
