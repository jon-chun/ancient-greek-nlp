    "title_en": "Trump and Meloni Discuss Opportunities for a Trade Agreement Between the United States and Europe",
    "text_summary_en": "US President Donald Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni discussed the possibility of reaching a trade agreement between the US and Europe during Meloni's visit to Washington. Trump stated that a trade agreement is possible but must be fair, while Meloni expressed confidence in reaching an agreement, aiming to \"make the West great again.\" Meloni is the first European leader to visit Washington since Trump imposed tariffs on EU imports. They discussed military spending, immigration, and tariffs. Meloni hopes to act as a bridge between the EU and the US, given strained relations and concerns about Trump's tariffs. Trump had previously criticized the EU's trade practices. Meloni secured a commitment from Trump to visit Rome and potentially meet with other European leaders. She also aligned herself with Trump's views on immigration and \"woke ideology.\" She promoted Italy's strong economic performance under her leadership. While no immediate tariff breakthroughs were achieved, Meloni's visit is seen as a potential victory in improving US-EU relations.",
