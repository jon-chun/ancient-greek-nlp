    "title_en": "Palestinian President Meets Syrian Counterpart in Damascus for the First Time Since 2007",
    "text_summary_en": "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met with Syrian transitional leader Ahmed al-Shara in Damascus, marking the first such visit since al-Shara assumed power. This visit is part of a Palestinian diplomatic effort to strengthen bilateral relations. The visit was initially delayed by Israeli authorities preventing the passage of the Palestinian President's helicopters. The Palestinian delegation carried important files for discussion, emphasizing the importance of strong relations between Palestine and Syria, regardless of the political system. Key issues include shared strategic interests, the Israeli occupation, regional security, and the impact of the \"Iranian axis.\" Discussions also covered the situation of Palestinian refugees in Syria, particularly the need for reconstruction of damaged camps and the return of displaced persons. Concerns about potential displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to Syria were dismissed as rumors. The visit also addresses the need for coordinated political positions in the region and the impact of Israeli policies on both Syria and Palestine. The article also mentions external pressures, particularly from the US, regarding political activities of Palestinian factions in Syria.",
