    "title_en": "What is the impact of the trade war between the United States and China on the global economy?",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the escalating trade war between the US and China, triggered by increased tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese goods, with China retaliating in kind. The trade volume between the two countries was approximately $585 billion last year, with the US importing significantly more from China than vice versa, resulting in a substantial trade deficit for the US. Previous tariffs had already reduced the US's reliance on Chinese imports, but some Chinese exports were rerouted through Southeast Asian countries to avoid tariffs. Key exports from the US to China include soybeans, medicines, and oil, while China exports electronics, computers, games, and batteries to the US. The trade war impacts companies like Apple and could lead to China restricting exports of vital minerals. The US may further restrict China's access to advanced microchips. A full-scale trade war could significantly harm the global economy, slowing growth and potentially causing recessions. There's also a risk of China \"dumping\" excess goods into global markets, potentially harming producers in other countries.",
