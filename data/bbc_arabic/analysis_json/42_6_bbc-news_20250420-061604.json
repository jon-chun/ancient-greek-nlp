    "title_en": "How Climate Change Can Affect the Level of Toxic Arsenic in Rice",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses the alarming discovery that rising carbon emissions and global temperatures are increasing arsenic levels in rice, a staple food for over half the world's population. While arsenic in rice has long been a known issue, a new study reveals that climate change exacerbates the problem, potentially leading to a significant increase in cancer cases. Researchers found that higher CO2 levels and temperatures correlate with increased arsenic accumulation in rice grains. The study highlights the potential health risks, including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, associated with consuming even small amounts of inorganic arsenic. The article also explores methods to reduce arsenic levels in rice through cooking techniques and alternative farming practices, while emphasizing the need for stricter regulations and monitoring of arsenic exposure in food.",
