    "title_en": "Why is Trump attacking China on trade? And what might happen next?",
    "text_summary_en": "The article discusses Donald Trump's renewed focus on trade tensions with China. It highlights Trump's view of China's economic model as detrimental to the US and his determination to reshape the global trade system. The article recalls the prevailing view in 2012 that increasing trade with China was beneficial, but notes that China's political and economic trajectory has not aligned with those expectations. Despite previous tariffs, China's economic dominance continues, particularly in sectors like electric vehicles. The article poses key questions about whether China will negotiate and make concessions, and whether the US still believes in free trade. It concludes that the world's two largest economies could be heading towards a struggle for economic dominance, potentially disrupting the established global order.",
