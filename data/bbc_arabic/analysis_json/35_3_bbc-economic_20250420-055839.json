    "title_en": "China Delivers a \"Painful\" Blow to the United States by Using Rare Earth Metals as a Weapon",
    "text_summary_en": "The trade war between China and the United States is intensifying, with observers focusing on retaliatory tariffs. However, China has also restricted exports of rare earth metals, seen as a significant blow to the US, highlighting American dependence. President Trump directed the Commerce Department to boost US production and reduce import reliance. Rare earth metals are crucial for high-tech manufacturing. China dominates extraction and refining, controlling the supply chain. This dominance stems from strategic policies over decades, prioritizing production even with lower environmental standards. China's restrictions on exporting seven rare earth metals, especially those crucial for defense, have put the US in a difficult position. The US relied heavily on Chinese imports for these metals. This move could significantly impact US defense and industry, potentially causing production delays and price increases. The US is considering diversifying supply chains and increasing domestic production, but this requires substantial investment. Trump has ordered an investigation into the risks of relying on imported rare earth metals and is eyeing alternative sources like Ukraine and Greenland.",
