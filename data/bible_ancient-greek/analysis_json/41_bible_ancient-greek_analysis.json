    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of Luke, based on the content and style.",
    "text_summary": "This segment from the Gospel describes several events and teachings of Jesus. It begins with an instance of disciples forbidding someone from casting out demons because they were not part of their group, which Jesus rebukes, stating that whoever is not against them is for them. The passage then recounts Jesus setting his face towards Jerusalem, sending messengers ahead to a Samaritan village, but being rejected because of his destination. James and John suggest calling down fire on the Samaritans, but Jesus rebukes them. It continues with three instances of potential followers: one who vows to follow Jesus anywhere, but is told that even animals have homes while the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head; another who is called to follow but asks to bury his father first, to which Jesus replies that the dead should bury the dead, and he should proclaim the Kingdom of God; and a third who wants to say goodbye to his family, but Jesus states that one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the Kingdom. The passage concludes with Jesus sending out seventy-two disciples, instructing them to heal the sick, proclaim the Kingdom of God, and rely on God's provision, warning them of the dangers they will face but promising them authority and rejoicing in the power given to them. Jesus rejoices in the Holy Spirit, thanking God for revealing these things to the simple. He declares that all things have been handed over to him by the Father."
