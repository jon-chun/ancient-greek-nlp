    "text_identification": "New Testament, likely from one of Paul's letters (possibly 2 Corinthians).",
    "text_summary": "This segment appears to be from a letter where Paul defends his ministry and apostleship. He addresses concerns about his perceived foolishness, lack of eloquence, and acceptance of support from other churches. He expresses his zeal for the Corinthians, comparing them to a pure virgin betrothed to Christ. He warns them against being deceived by false apostles who disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, much like Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Paul recounts his many sufferings and hardships endured for the sake of the Gospel, highlighting his dedication and contrasting it with the deceptive practices of his opponents. He emphasizes his love for the Corinthians, despite their criticisms, and his determination to remove any opportunity for false teachers to boast."
