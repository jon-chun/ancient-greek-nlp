    "text_summary": "This passage contains a discussion about the roles of John the Baptist and Jesus, emphasizing Jesus's increasing importance. John the Baptist acknowledges that Jesus must increase while he decreases and that Jesus comes from above. It also includes a conversation between Jesus and a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well. Jesus offers her \"living water,\" which will quench her spiritual thirst forever. He reveals knowledge of her past, leading her to believe he is a prophet. They discuss the proper place to worship God, with Jesus stating that true worship will be in spirit and truth. Jesus then reveals himself as the Messiah to her. The disciples return and are surprised to see Jesus speaking with a woman. The woman leaves and tells the townspeople about Jesus."
