    "text_summary": "This text segment encompasses several episodes. It begins with Jesus' disciples urging him to eat, but Jesus states his food is to do the will of God. He then speaks about the harvest being ripe, implying spiritual readiness. Many Samaritans believe in Jesus because of the woman's testimony. Jesus stays with them for two days, and many more believe. He then returns to Galilee, where he is received, though he acknowledges a prophet has no honor in his own country. The segment concludes with the healing of a nobleman's son in Capernaum and the healing of a paralytic at the pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem, followed by a conflict with the Jewish authorities over healing on the Sabbath. Jesus instructs the healed man to carry his mat, leading to further conflict."
