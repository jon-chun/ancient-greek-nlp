    "text_summary": "This segment contains several distinct episodes. First, a blind man is healed by Jesus after repeatedly calling out to him as the \"Son of David.\" Jesus asks what he wants, and the blind man asks for his sight. Jesus heals him, attributing it to the man's faith. Next, Jesus and his disciples approach Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives. He sends two disciples to find a colt that has never been ridden and bring it to him. He instructs them on what to say if questioned. The disciples find the colt, and people question them, but they respond as instructed. They bring the colt to Jesus, place their garments on it, and Jesus rides into Jerusalem. People spread their garments and branches on the road, hailing him as the one who comes in the name of the Lord, blessing the coming kingdom of David. Jesus then enters the temple and looks around before leaving to Bethany with the twelve. The next day, on their way back from Bethany, Jesus curses a fig tree because it has leaves but no fruit. He then enters the temple again and drives out those selling and buying, overturning tables and chairs, and preventing people from carrying merchandise through the temple. He teaches that the temple should be a house of prayer for all nations, but they have made it a den of robbers. The chief priests and scribes seek to destroy him. Finally, the disciples notice the withered fig tree, and Peter points it out. Jesus tells them to have faith in God, stating that they can move mountains if they believe."
