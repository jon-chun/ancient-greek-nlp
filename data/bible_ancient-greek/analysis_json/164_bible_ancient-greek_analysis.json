    "text_summary": "This passage discusses the new covenant established through Jesus, where God promises to forgive sins and write His laws on the hearts of believers. It emphasizes the boldness believers have in entering God's presence through Jesus' sacrifice. The text urges believers to draw near to God with sincere hearts, maintain unwavering hope, and encourage one another in love and good works. It warns against willful sin after receiving knowledge of the truth, highlighting the dreadful judgment that awaits those who reject God's grace. It also encourages remembering past perseverance in suffering, and not to lose confidence. The passage concludes by defining faith as the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen, citing examples of faith from the Old Testament figures like Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Sarah."
