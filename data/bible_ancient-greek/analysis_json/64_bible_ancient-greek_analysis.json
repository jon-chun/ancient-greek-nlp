    "text_summary": "This passage from John's Gospel describes John the Baptist's testimony about Jesus, identifying him as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. John acknowledges Jesus's pre-existence and superior status, even though Jesus came after him. He recounts the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus in the form of a dove, confirming Jesus as the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and the Son of God. The passage then narrates the calling of the first disciples, Andrew and another unnamed disciple, who follow Jesus after hearing John's declaration. Andrew then brings his brother Simon Peter to Jesus, who renames him Cephas (Peter). Finally, Jesus calls Philip, who in turn finds Nathanael and tells him about Jesus. Nathanael is initially skeptical but, after an encounter with Jesus, proclaims him the Son of God and King of Israel."
