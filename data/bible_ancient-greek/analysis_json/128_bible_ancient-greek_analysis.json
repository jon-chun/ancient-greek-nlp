    "text_summary": "This passage from Galatians discusses the relationship between faith and law in achieving righteousness. It argues that justification comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not through adherence to the works of the law. Paul emphasizes that if righteousness could be attained through the law, Christ's death would have been unnecessary. He rebukes the Galatians for turning away from faith to legalism, reminding them of their initial reception of the Spirit through faith. He uses the example of Abraham, who was justified by faith, to illustrate that those who believe are children of Abraham and blessed with him. The law, according to Paul, brought a curse that Christ redeemed believers from by becoming a curse for them. The purpose of the law was temporary, serving as a guardian until the coming of faith in Christ, through which believers become sons of God and are united in Christ, inheriting the promise made to Abraham. He cautions against reverting to legalistic practices after having known God."
