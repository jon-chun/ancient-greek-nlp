    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, specifically containing portions of 2 Corinthians and Galatians.",
    "text_summary": "This text segment contains excerpts from Paul's letters. The passage from 2 Corinthians expresses Paul's joy when the recipients are strong in faith, even if he is weak. He writes to build them up, not tear them down, and encourages them to rejoice, be made complete, agree with one another, live in peace, and greet one another with a holy kiss. The passage concludes with a benediction invoking the grace of Jesus, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Galatians portion begins with Paul asserting his apostleship comes directly from Jesus Christ and God the Father. He expresses astonishment that they are so quickly turning away from the true Gospel to a different one, which is actually a perversion. He pronounces a curse on anyone who preaches a gospel contrary to the one he delivered, even if it were an angel. He defends his ministry, stating that he seeks to please God, not men, and that the gospel he preaches was received through a revelation of Jesus Christ, not human instruction. He recounts his past persecution of the church and his subsequent calling by God to preach among the Gentiles. He briefly describes his visit to Jerusalem to meet with Peter (Cephas) and James."
