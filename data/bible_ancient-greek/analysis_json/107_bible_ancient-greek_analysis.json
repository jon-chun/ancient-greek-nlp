    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, specifically 1 Corinthians, chapters 3 and 4.",
    "text_summary": "This passage emphasizes the roles of different individuals in spreading the Gospel, using the analogy of planting and watering seeds, where God is the one who causes growth. It stresses that all laborers are united in purpose and will be rewarded according to their efforts. The passage highlights the church as God's building and warns against building on the foundation of Christ with inferior materials, as each person's work will be tested. It underscores the importance of the church as the temple of God and warns against its defilement. The passage also cautions against worldly wisdom and boasting, emphasizing that everything belongs to believers in Christ, who in turn belong to Christ, and Christ to God. Finally, it discusses the role of apostles as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries, stressing faithfulness and humility, and urging believers to imitate Paul's example. It also addresses issues of division and pride within the Corinthian church, contrasting their perceived wisdom and strength with the apostles' suffering and humility."
