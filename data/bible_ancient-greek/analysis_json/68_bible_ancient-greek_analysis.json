    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, specifically the Gospel of John, likely chapter 5 and 6.",
    "text_summary": "This passage from the Gospel of John includes Jesus defending his healing on the Sabbath and asserting his equality with God, leading to increased opposition from Jewish leaders who sought to kill him. Jesus explains his relationship with the Father, stating that he only does what he sees the Father doing and that the Father has given him the power to give life and judge. He emphasizes the importance of honoring the Son as they honor the Father, and believing in him for eternal life. He speaks of a future hour when the dead will hear his voice and live. Jesus affirms that the Father has testified about him, and that the scriptures also testify about him. The passage concludes with Jesus's rejection by some, his assertion that he seeks not his own glory but the Father's, and a reference to Moses as the one who will accuse them. The text then shifts to the feeding of the five thousand."
