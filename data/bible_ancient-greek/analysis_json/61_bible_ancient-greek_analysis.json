    "text_summary": "This passage describes the events leading up to and including the crucifixion of Jesus. It begins with the crowd demanding Jesus' crucifixion over the release of a prisoner. Simon of Cyrene is forced to carry the cross. Jesus tells the weeping women of Jerusalem to weep for themselves and their children, prophesying future hardship. He is crucified between two criminals. The soldiers and rulers mock him. One criminal rebukes the other for blaspheming Jesus, and Jesus promises that criminal paradise. Darkness falls. Jesus cries out to God and dies. A centurion acknowledges Jesus' righteousness. Joseph of Arimathea requests Jesus' body and places it in a tomb. The women who followed Jesus from Galilee observe the burial. The passage emphasizes themes of injustice, suffering, divine forgiveness, and the promise of salvation."
