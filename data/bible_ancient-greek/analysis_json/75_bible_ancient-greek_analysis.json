    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, specifically the Gospel of John. The first part references a claim by Jesus about existing before Abraham, a key theological point. The latter part describes the healing of a blind man and the subsequent investigation by the Pharisees.",
    "text_summary": "This passage contains two distinct episodes. First, Jesus claims pre-existence before Abraham, which provokes a hostile reaction from his audience. They attempt to stone him, but he escapes. Second, Jesus heals a man born blind. The healing is questioned by the disciples and then investigated by the Pharisees, who are divided on whether Jesus' actions are from God, given that he performed the healing on the Sabbath. The healed man testifies that Jesus healed him, leading the Pharisees to interrogate his parents, who are afraid to confirm the miracle. The healed man is then questioned again, defends Jesus, and is cast out. Finally, Jesus finds the man, reveals himself as the Son of Man, and the man worships him. Jesus states he came to bring sight to the blind and blindness to those who see."
