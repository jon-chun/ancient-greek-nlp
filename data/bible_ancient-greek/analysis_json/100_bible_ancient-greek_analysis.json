    "text_summary": "This passage discusses the stumbling of Israel and the availability of salvation to both Jews and Gentiles through faith in Jesus Christ. It addresses why Israel, despite having zeal for God, failed to attain righteousness. The passage explains that they sought it through works of the law rather than through faith. It emphasizes that Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. The text then highlights the accessibility of salvation through faith, quoting Old Testament passages to support the idea that belief in Jesus as Lord and his resurrection leads to salvation. It concludes by discussing the necessity of preaching and hearing the Gospel for people to believe and be saved, and touches on Israel's rejection of God's message, referencing Isaiah and Moses. The passage also touches on God's election and mercy."
