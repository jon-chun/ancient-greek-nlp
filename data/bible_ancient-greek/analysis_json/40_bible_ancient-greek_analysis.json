    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely from one of the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, or Luke), specifically dealing with the Transfiguration of Jesus and a subsequent healing.",
    "text_summary": "This passage recounts two key events. First, Jesus takes Peter, John, and James up a mountain where he is transfigured, appearing in glory alongside Moses and Elijah. A cloud overshadows them, and a voice from the cloud proclaims Jesus as God's chosen Son, commanding the disciples to listen to him. The disciples are awestruck and fearful. Second, upon descending the mountain, they encounter a crowd and a man whose son is possessed by a demon. The disciples are unable to heal the boy. Jesus rebukes the faithless generation, heals the boy, and restores him to his father. The people are amazed by God's power. Jesus then foretells his betrayal and death, but the disciples do not understand and are afraid to ask him about it. A discussion arises among them about who is the greatest, and Jesus uses a child as an example of humility and acceptance in his name. John reports that they saw someone casting out demons in Jesus' name."
