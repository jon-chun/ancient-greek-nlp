    "text_summary": "This passage describes the events leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus. Pilate attempts to release Jesus, finding no fault in him, and offers the crowd the customary release of a prisoner during Passover. The crowd chooses Barabbas instead. Roman soldiers mock and torture Jesus, placing a crown of thorns on his head and a purple robe on his shoulders. Pilate presents Jesus to the crowd, saying, \"Behold, the man!\" The chief priests demand his crucifixion. Pilate, after further questioning Jesus and facing pressure from the Jewish leaders who threaten to accuse him of disloyalty to Caesar, reluctantly hands Jesus over to be crucified. Jesus is then led to Golgotha, where he is crucified between two others. Pilate has a title placed on the cross proclaiming Jesus as \"The King of the Jews\" in multiple languages. The soldiers divide Jesus' garments, fulfilling prophecy. Jesus, while on the cross, speaks to his mother and the disciple whom he loved. He then declares \"I thirst,\" and after receiving a drink, indicates that his mission is accomplished."
