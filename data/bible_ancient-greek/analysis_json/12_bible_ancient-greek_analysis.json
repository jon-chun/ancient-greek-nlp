    "text_summary": "This segment contains several distinct episodes. First, a woman's daughter is healed after Jesus initially hesitates, referencing feeding children first. Then, a deaf and mute man is healed by Jesus through a physical and spiritual act. Jesus instructs people to keep the miracle a secret, but they proclaim it even more. The text then describes Jesus feeding a large crowd of four thousand people with seven loaves of bread and a few fish, resulting in an abundance of leftovers. Finally, the Pharisees ask for a sign, which Jesus refuses to give, and he warns his disciples against the leaven of the Pharisees and Herod, which they initially misunderstand as a lack of bread. Jesus rebukes them for their lack of understanding."
