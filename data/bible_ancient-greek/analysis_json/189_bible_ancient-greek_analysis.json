    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, specifically chapters 8 and 9.",
    "text_summary": "This passage describes a series of apocalyptic events triggered by the blowing of seven trumpets by seven angels. The events include silence in heaven, the offering of incense with prayers, and then catastrophic events on Earth: hail and fire mixed with blood, a burning mountain thrown into the sea, a star falling and poisoning rivers, darkness covering the sun, moon, and stars, and a plague of locusts with scorpion-like tails. These locusts torment those without God's seal. The passage further describes a vast army of horsemen whose horses breathe fire, smoke, and sulfur, killing a third of mankind. Despite these plagues, the remaining people do not repent of their idolatry, murders, sorceries, sexual immorality, or thefts. Finally, a mighty angel descends from heaven, veiled in a cloud, and cries out with a loud voice, followed by the voices of seven thunders, which John is commanded not to write down."
