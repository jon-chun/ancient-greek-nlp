    "text_summary": "This passage describes the fall of a great city (likely symbolic of Rome or a similar power), highlighting the cessation of commerce, artistry, and joy within it. The city's downfall is attributed to its merchants' influence and its deceptive practices, particularly sorcery, which led nations astray. The city is also condemned for the blood of prophets and saints found within it. Following this, the text shifts to a scene of heavenly rejoicing, with multitudes praising God for his righteous judgment against the \"great prostitute\" who corrupted the earth. The wedding of the Lamb is announced, and believers are declared blessed. A vision of a rider on a white horse is described, representing the Word of God, who judges and makes war in righteousness."
