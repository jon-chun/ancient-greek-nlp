He describes his tender care for them, comparing himself to a nursing mother. He reminds them of his hard work and blameless conduct. He expresses gratitude for their acceptance of his message as the word of God, and acknowledges their suffering, mirroring that of the churches in Judea. He laments being separated from them, thwarted in his attempts to return, and expresses his deep longing to see them again. Finally, he mentions sending Timothy to strengthen their faith amidst tribulations, and expresses joy upon hearing of their steadfastness. The passage showcases themes of genuine ministry, affection, perseverance, suffering, and longing."
