    "text_summary": "This passage describes the actions of a beast that performs great signs, deceiving people and causing them to worship an image of the beast. Those who refuse to worship the image are killed. The beast also marks people on their right hand or forehead, preventing them from buying or selling without the mark, which is the name or number of the beast. The number of the beast is 666. Then, the Lamb stands on Mount Zion with 144,000 who have his name and his Father's name on their foreheads. They sing a new song that only they can learn. These are those who have not defiled themselves with women and are without falsehood. An angel proclaims the eternal gospel to all nations, calling them to fear God and worship the Creator. Another angel announces the fall of Babylon. A third angel warns against worshiping the beast or its image, stating that those who do will suffer eternal torment. This calls for the endurance of the saints, who keep God's commandments and the faith of Jesus. A voice from heaven declares blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. Finally, a white cloud appears with someone like the Son of Man, wearing a golden crown and holding a sharp sickle."
