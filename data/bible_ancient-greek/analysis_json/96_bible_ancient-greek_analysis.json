    "text_summary": "This passage explores the relationship between sin, grace, law, and righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. It argues that believers have died to sin and been raised to new life in Christ through baptism, freeing them from the dominion of sin. The text emphasizes that believers are no longer under the law but under grace, and therefore should not continue in sin. It highlights the contrast between being slaves to sin, which leads to death, and being slaves to righteousness, which leads to sanctification and eternal life. The passage also discusses the role of the law in revealing sin and its consequences, ultimately pointing to the freedom and new life available through faith in Christ."
