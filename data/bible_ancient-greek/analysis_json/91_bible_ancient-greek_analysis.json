    "text_summary": "This text from the Book of Acts chronicles the early days of the Christian church, starting with Jesus' ascension and the selection of Matthias to replace Judas. It then describes the Pentecost event, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and Peter's sermon explaining the event as the fulfillment of prophecy. The text recounts miracles performed by the apostles, including the healing of a lame man, and the apostles' subsequent arrest and release. It also details the growth of the church, including the communal sharing of possessions, and the story of Ananias and Sapphira's deceit and death. The text then describes the apostles' continued ministry, including signs and wonders, persecution, and imprisonment, followed by miraculous deliverance and continued preaching. Finally, it discusses the appointment of deacons to address the needs of Hellenistic widows, Stephen's ministry and martyrdom, and Philip's evangelistic work in Samaria. The text also includes the conversion of Saul (Paul) and Peter's ministry to the Gentiles."
