    "text_summary": "This segment describes a series of apocalyptic events. Two witnesses are resurrected and ascend to heaven, causing great fear. A great earthquake destroys a tenth of a city, killing thousands. The seventh angel blows his trumpet, heralding the reign of God and Christ. The twenty-four elders worship God, giving thanks for his power and reign. God's temple in heaven opens, revealing the Ark of the Covenant. A woman clothed with the sun, moon, and stars is about to give birth and is threatened by a dragon. She gives birth to a son who is taken to God. A war in heaven ensues, with Michael and his angels defeating the dragon, who is cast down to earth, along with his angels. A voice proclaims salvation, power, and the kingdom of God. The dragon persecutes the woman, who is given wings to escape. The dragon sends a flood after her."
