    "text_summary": "This passage discusses Paul's positive report about Titus's reception by the Corinthians and Paul's confidence in them. It then shifts to the generosity of the Macedonian churches, who, despite their poverty and trials, gave willingly to support the saints. Paul uses this as an example to encourage the Corinthians to also be generous in their giving, emphasizing equality and mutual support within the Christian community. He reminds them of the grace of Jesus Christ, who became poor so that they might become rich. The passage concludes with Paul expressing gratitude for Titus's zeal for the Corinthians and his willingness to return to them. He is also sending another brother with Titus."
