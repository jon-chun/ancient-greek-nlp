    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the feeding of the five thousand by Jesus, his subsequent withdrawal to the mountain, and the disciples' journey across the sea. Jesus walks on water, calming their fears. The crowd, realizing Jesus and his disciples have departed, seeks him out in Capernaum. Jesus then teaches them about seeking spiritual nourishment rather than merely physical satisfaction. He identifies himself as the bread of life, promising that those who come to him will never hunger or thirst. The people question him, referencing the manna in the desert, and Jesus clarifies that God, not Moses, provides the true bread from heaven, which gives life to the world."
