    "text_identification": "This segment appears to be from the New Testament, likely containing excerpts from the Gospel of Mark (specifically the ending) and the beginning of the Gospel of Luke.",
    "text_summary": "The first part of the segment describes the resurrection of Jesus and his appearances to Mary Magdalene and other disciples. The disciples initially disbelieve the accounts of the resurrection. Jesus then appears to the eleven apostles, rebukes them for their unbelief, and commissions them to preach the Gospel to all creation. He promises signs that will accompany believers, such as casting out demons, speaking in tongues, and healing the sick. The passage concludes with Jesus' ascension into heaven. Following this is a brief summary of the preaching by Peter's companions, and then a declaration of Jesus sending the message of salvation from east to west. The subsequent section shifts to the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, introducing the author's purpose in writing an orderly account of the events witnessed and passed down by eyewitnesses, addressed to Theophilus. It then introduces Zechariah and Elizabeth, an elderly, righteous couple, and the angel's announcement of John the Baptist's birth. The angel foretells John's greatness and his role in preparing the way for the Lord. Zechariah expresses doubt, resulting in him being struck mute until the child's birth."
