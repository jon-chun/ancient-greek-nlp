    "text_summary": "This passage discusses the suffering of Christ and its implications for believers. It emphasizes that suffering for doing good is preferable to suffering for doing evil, as Christ himself suffered for sins. The passage refers to Christ's preaching to spirits in prison, linking it to Noah's ark and baptism as a symbol of salvation. Believers are encouraged to live according to God's will rather than human desires, having already spent enough time indulging in worldly passions. Judgment is coming for both the living and the dead, and even the gospel was preached to the dead so they might live according to God in the spirit. The end of all things is near, so believers should be sober-minded, loving, and hospitable. They should use their gifts to serve one another, glorifying God through Jesus Christ. They should not be surprised by fiery trials but rejoice in sharing Christ's sufferings. Suffering as a Christian should not bring shame but lead to glorifying God. Judgment begins with God's household, and the righteous are barely saved. Therefore, those who suffer according to God's will should entrust their souls to him in doing good. Elders are exhorted to shepherd the flock willingly, not for selfish gain, and to be examples to the flock. Younger men should submit to elders, and all should clothe themselves with humility. God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. They should humble themselves under God's hand, casting their anxieties on him because he cares for them. They are to be sober and watchful because the devil seeks to devour them. They should resist him, firm in their faith, knowing that their brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering."
