    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of John.",
    "text_summary": "This text segment contains several interconnected narratives and theological points. It starts with a confrontation between Jesus and some Jewish people who question his identity as the Christ. Jesus responds by pointing to his works as evidence of his divine authority and emphasizes that his followers are those who listen to his voice. He declares his unity with the Father. This leads to an attempt to stone him for blasphemy. Jesus defends himself by referencing scripture and highlighting his divine mission. The narrative then shifts to the story of Lazarus's illness and death. Jesus expresses his love for Lazarus and his sisters, Martha and Mary, and declares that Lazarus's illness is not unto death but for the glory of God. He delays his journey to Bethany and then announces his intention to raise Lazarus from the dead, causing some confusion and concern among his disciples."
