    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, specifically the Gospel of John. The passage includes the story of the woman caught in adultery (which is often debated as to its original inclusion) and a discourse by Jesus about being the light of the world and his relationship with the Father.",
    "text_summary": "The text segment begins with the debated story of Jesus and the woman caught in adultery. Jesus cleverly avoids condemning her, challenging those without sin to cast the first stone, leading to everyone leaving and Jesus forgiving her. Following this, Jesus declares himself the light of the world, promising that those who follow him will not walk in darkness but have the light of life. The Pharisees challenge his self-testimony, which Jesus defends by stating his knowledge of his origin and destination, which they do not possess. He further asserts that his judgment is true because he is not alone but with the Father who sent him. He points out that their own law requires two witnesses, and he and the Father are those witnesses. The Jews then question where his Father is. Jesus responds that they know neither him nor his Father, and if they knew him, they would know the Father. He states he is going away, and they will seek him but die in their sin, unable to come where he is going. This prompts a discussion about suicide. Jesus contrasts their earthly origin with his heavenly origin, stating they are of this world, but he is not. He warns them that they will die in their sins if they do not believe that he is who he claims to be. They ask him who he is."
