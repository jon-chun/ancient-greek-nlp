    "text_summary": "This passage from 2 Corinthians expresses Paul's ministry and relationship with the Corinthian church. He describes the hardships and paradoxes of his ministry, emphasizing his genuine love and openness towards them. He urges them to reciprocate his affection and to separate themselves from unbelievers, highlighting the incompatibility of righteousness and lawlessness, light and darkness, Christ and Belial. He reminds them that they are the temple of the living God, and calls them to purify themselves from all defilement. Paul then expresses his joy at Titus's arrival and the positive response of the Corinthians to his previous letter, which caused them sorrow leading to repentance. He emphasizes that godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation. He rejoices in their eagerness, defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and avengement, demonstrating their purity in the matter."
