    "text_summary": "This passage begins with a statement about recompense at the resurrection of the righteous. Then, someone remarks about the blessedness of eating in the Kingdom of God. Jesus responds with the parable of the Great Banquet. A man prepares a large dinner and invites many guests, but they all make excuses and decline. The host, angered by their rejection, instructs his servant to invite the poor, crippled, blind, and lame from the streets. Even after this, there is still room, so the host orders the servant to go out to the roads and compel people to come, so that his house may be filled. The passage then shifts to the cost of discipleship, stating that one must hate their family and even their own life to be a disciple, and must carry their own cross. It concludes with examples of the need to consider the cost before building a tower or going to war."
