    "text_summary": "This passage contains two distinct episodes. First, it describes Jesus forgiving a woman's sins, prompting questions about his authority. He then affirms her faith and sends her away in peace. Second, it introduces Jesus traveling with his disciples and several women who support them financially, some of whom had been healed of demonic possession or illnesses. Included is Mary Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been cast out. The passage then shifts to the Parable of the Sower, where Jesus describes seeds falling on different types of ground, yielding varying results. He concludes by urging listeners to hear and understand. The parable is then explained, with the seed representing the word of God and the different grounds representing different types of listeners and their responses to the word. Finally, the passage discusses the purpose of a lamp, which is to provide light, not to be hidden. It ends with a warning to pay attention to what is heard, as those who have will receive more, and those who do not will lose even what they seem to have. The passage concludes with Jesus' mother and brothers arriving to see him."
