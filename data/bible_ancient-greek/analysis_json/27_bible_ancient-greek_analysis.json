    "text_summary": "This passage from the Gospel of Luke recounts Mary's visit to Elizabeth after the Annunciation. Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, recognizes Mary as the mother of the Lord and blesses her and the child she carries. Mary responds with the Magnificat, a hymn of praise to God for his favor and justice. The passage continues with the birth of John the Baptist. The neighbors and relatives want to name him Zacharias after his father, but Elizabeth insists on the name John, which is confirmed by Zacharias after he writes it down, resulting in his speech being restored. Fear and wonder spread among the people, and they ponder the child's future. Zacharias, filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesies."
