    "text_summary": "This passage describes the release of Barabbas, a prisoner, at the request of the crowd incited by the chief priests, and the condemnation of Jesus by Pilate. Despite Pilate's attempts to release Jesus, the crowd demands his crucifixion. Jesus is then mocked and abused by the soldiers, dressed in purple robes and a crown of thorns, before being led away to be crucified. Simon of Cyrene is forced to carry the cross. The passage details the crucifixion itself, including the division of Jesus' garments and the inscription declaring him \"King of the Jews\". Two robbers are crucified alongside him. Passersby and chief priests mock Jesus. Darkness falls over the land. Jesus cries out in agony."
