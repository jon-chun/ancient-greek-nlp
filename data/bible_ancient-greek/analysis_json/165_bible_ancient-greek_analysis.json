    "text_summary": "This passage from Hebrews 11 focuses on the theme of faith, illustrating its power through examples of Old Testament figures. It speaks of those who sought a heavenly country, for whom God prepared a city. It then recounts the acts of faith performed by Abraham (offering Isaac), Isaac (blessing Jacob and Esau), Jacob (blessing Joseph's sons), Joseph (prophesying about the exodus), Moses (being hidden as a baby and later rejecting Pharaoh's daughter), and the Israelites (observing the Passover and crossing the Red Sea). The passage continues by mentioning the fall of Jericho and Rahab's salvation. Finally, it lists many other faithful individuals who conquered kingdoms, worked righteousness, and endured various trials, all sustained by their faith. These individuals, though commended for their faith, did not receive the promised reward in their lifetime, as God had planned something better for believers in the future, so that they might be perfected together. The passage concludes by encouraging the readers to run the race of faith with perseverance, looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of their faith."
