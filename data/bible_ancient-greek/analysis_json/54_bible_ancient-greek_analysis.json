    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely from the Gospel of Luke, containing accounts of Jesus's ministry.",
    "text_summary": "This segment begins with a prediction of Jesus's death and resurrection, which the disciples do not understand. It then recounts the healing of a blind man near Jericho who calls out to Jesus for mercy and is healed through his faith. The crowd praises God. Next, it tells the story of Zacchaeus, a wealthy tax collector, who climbs a tree to see Jesus. Jesus invites himself to Zacchaeus's house, causing grumbling among the people. Zacchaeus repents and promises to give to the poor and repay those he has defrauded. Jesus declares that salvation has come to Zacchaeus's house. Finally, Jesus tells a parable about a nobleman who entrusts money to his servants before going away to receive a kingdom. Upon his return, he rewards the faithful servants and punishes the unfaithful one. The parable ends with a statement about taking away from those who do not have and a threat to the nobleman's enemies."
