    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, specifically dealing with the visions of the end times, the fall of Babylon, and the judgment of the wicked.",
    "text_summary": "This text segment describes a vision of a great harlot, representing a corrupt city (Babylon), sitting on many waters and influencing the kings of the earth with her immorality. The vision shifts to a woman riding a scarlet beast covered in blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns. She is adorned with riches and holds a golden cup full of abominations. The woman is identified as Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots. The seer witnesses her drunken with the blood of saints and martyrs. An angel explains the mystery of the woman and the beast. The beast was, is not, and will ascend from the bottomless pit. The seven heads are interpreted as seven mountains and seven kings. The ten horns are ten kings who will give their power to the beast. These kings will war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them. The waters represent peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues. The ten horns and the beast will hate the harlot, make her desolate, and consume her flesh. God put it in their hearts to fulfill His will. The woman is the great city that reigns over the kings of the earth. Another angel announces the fall of Babylon, now a dwelling place of demons. God remembers her iniquities and commands His people to come out of her.\nFinally, the text describes the merchants of the earth who grew rich from the power of her luxury."
