    "text_summary": "This passage contains Jesus's farewell discourse to his disciples before his crucifixion. He speaks of their coming sorrow turning to joy after he departs and promises that their prayers will be answered in his name. He explains that he has spoken in parables but will soon speak plainly about the Father. He emphasizes the Father's love for them because they have loved him and believed he came from God. Jesus then prays to the Father, glorifying him and requesting to be glorified in return. He highlights his work in revealing the Father to his disciples, emphasizing their obedience to God's word. Jesus prays not for the world, but for his disciples, asking the Father to protect them and keep them united, as he prepares to leave the world and return to the Father. He states that he has given them God's word and that the world hates them."
