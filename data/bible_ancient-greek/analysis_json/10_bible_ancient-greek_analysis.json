    "text_summary": "This passage recounts two distinct episodes. First, Jesus sends his disciples ahead by boat and then walks on water to meet them during a storm. The disciples are frightened, mistaking him for a ghost, but Jesus reassures them. He joins them in the boat, and the wind ceases. The disciples are amazed, failing to understand the significance of the earlier miracle of the loaves. Second, after landing at Gennesaret, Jesus is recognized, and people bring the sick to him to be healed by touching his garment. The passage concludes with the Pharisees and scribes questioning why Jesus' disciples do not follow the tradition of washing their hands before eating. Jesus rebukes them, quoting Isaiah and accusing them of hypocrisy for prioritizing human traditions over God's commandments."
