    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of John, specifically chapter 6, focusing on Jesus's discourse about the Bread of Life.",
    "text_summary": "This passage from John 6 centers on Jesus's teaching about himself as the \"Bread of Life,\" sent from heaven to provide eternal life. He contrasts this with the manna eaten by their ancestors in the desert, which did not prevent death. Jesus claims that those who believe in him will have eternal life and be resurrected on the last day. This teaching causes dissent among the Jews, who question his claim of descending from heaven, knowing his earthly parentage. Jesus responds by stating that no one can come to him unless drawn by the Father. He emphasizes the necessity of believing in him to receive eternal life. He further elaborates on this concept, stating that one must eat his flesh and drink his blood to have life within them. This statement causes further division, with many disciples finding it a difficult teaching. Jesus acknowledges their skepticism and points to his eventual ascension. Ultimately, many disciples abandon him, but Peter affirms his belief in Jesus as the Holy One of God, possessing the words of eternal life. Jesus then reveals that even among the twelve, one is a devil, referring to Judas Iscariot."
