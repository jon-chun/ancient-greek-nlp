    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the Last Supper where Jesus shares a final meal with his disciples, institutes the Eucharist (sharing bread and wine as symbols of his body and blood), and predicts that one of them will betray him. The disciples express distress and question their own potential for betrayal. Jesus also foretells Peter's denial. Following the meal, they go to the Mount of Olives, specifically Gethsemane, where Jesus prays in anguish, anticipating his impending suffering and death. He asks God to take the cup of suffering from him, but ultimately submits to God's will. He finds his disciples asleep and urges them to stay awake and pray. Finally, Judas arrives with a crowd to betray Jesus."
