It emphasizes the importance of believers living in harmony, glorifying God together, and accepting one another as Christ accepted them. The text quotes from the Old Testament to demonstrate God's intention to extend salvation to both Jews and Gentiles. It also speaks of Paul's ministry to the Gentiles, his desire to visit Rome, and his upcoming trip to Jerusalem to deliver aid to the saints. The passage concludes with a call for prayer and a commendation of Phoebe, a deaconess."
