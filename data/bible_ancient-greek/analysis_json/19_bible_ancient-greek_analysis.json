    "text_summary": "This text segment describes a series of events that will precede the end times. It warns of deception, wars, earthquakes, and famines. Believers are told they will be persecuted, arrested, beaten, and brought before rulers to testify. The gospel must first be preached to all nations. They are not to worry about what to say when arrested, as the Holy Spirit will guide them. Betrayal within families will occur, leading to death. They will be hated for Jesus' name, but those who endure to the end will be saved. The abomination of desolation will signal a time to flee. The passage describes a time of great tribulation, such as has never been seen before. False Christs and prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders. The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky."
