    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely the Book of Hebrews, due to its discussion of the Old Testament sacrificial system, the role of the high priest, and the superiority of Christ's sacrifice.",
    "text_summary": "This passage contrasts the Old Testament sacrificial system with the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The Old Testament required repeated sacrifices and a high priest entering the Holy of Holies annually with blood for atonement. This system, however, could not truly cleanse the conscience. Jesus, as the ultimate high priest, entered the heavenly sanctuary once for all with his own blood, securing eternal redemption. His sacrifice is superior, cleansing the conscience and offering true forgiveness. The passage highlights the inadequacy of the old covenant and the perfection of the new covenant established through Christ's sacrifice. It also touches upon the concept of death and judgment, and Christ's second coming for salvation. The text emphasizes that Christ's sacrifice is a one-time event that perfects those who are sanctified and anticipates his return to bring full salvation to those who await him."
