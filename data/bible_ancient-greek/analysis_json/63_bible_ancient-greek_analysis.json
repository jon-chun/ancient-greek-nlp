    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely containing portions from the Gospel of Luke (specifically the Emmaus Road narrative and the appearance to the eleven disciples) and the Gospel of John (specifically the prologue).",
    "text_summary": "The text begins with the resurrected Jesus appearing to disciples who recognize him, but then he vanishes. They recount their experience of feeling their hearts burning as he explained the scriptures. The disciples return to Jerusalem and find the eleven apostles gathered, who tell them that Jesus has appeared to Simon. Jesus then appears to all of them, causing fear and disbelief. He proves his physical reality by showing his hands and feet, and eating in front of them. He explains that the scriptures foretold his suffering, resurrection, and the preaching of repentance for forgiveness of sins to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem, and that they are witnesses to these things. He promises the Holy Spirit. The text then transitions to the prologue of the Gospel of John, which speaks of the Word (Logos) being with God and being God, the source of life and light, and the testimony of John the Baptist. It describes the Word becoming flesh and dwelling among humanity, full of grace and truth."
