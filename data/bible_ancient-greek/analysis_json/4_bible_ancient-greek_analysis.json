    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament.",
    "text_summary": "This segment covers several distinct episodes. It begins with a discussion about fasting, with Jesus explaining that his disciples do not fast while he is with them, comparing himself to a bridegroom. He uses parables of new cloth on old garments and new wine in old wineskins to illustrate the incompatibility of old and new ways. The passage then describes the disciples picking grain on the Sabbath, leading to a confrontation with the Pharisees, where Jesus defends their actions by referencing David's similar act. Jesus declares that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath, and that he is Lord of the Sabbath. It continues with Jesus healing a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath in the synagogue, provoking the Pharisees to plot his death. The passage ends with Jesus withdrawing to the sea, where he is followed by a large crowd, and he chooses the twelve apostles. The crowd seeks healing, and unclean spirits acknowledge him as the Son of God. Finally, it describes the apostles' inability to even eat due to the crowds."
