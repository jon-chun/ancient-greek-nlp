    "text_summary": "This passage contains several distinct episodes. First, Jesus redefines his family as those who hear and do the word of God. Then, Jesus calms a storm on a lake, questioning his disciples' faith. Next, Jesus heals a demon-possessed man in the region of the Gerasenes, casting the demons into a herd of pigs that rush into a lake and drown. The healed man wishes to follow Jesus, but Jesus sends him back to his home to proclaim what God has done for him. Finally, Jesus returns and is met by a crowd. Jairus, a synagogue leader, pleads with Jesus to heal his dying daughter. On the way, a woman with a hemorrhage is healed by touching Jesus' cloak. Jesus acknowledges her faith. News arrives that Jairus' daughter has died, but Jesus encourages Jairus to believe, and he proceeds to Jairus' house to raise the girl from the dead."
