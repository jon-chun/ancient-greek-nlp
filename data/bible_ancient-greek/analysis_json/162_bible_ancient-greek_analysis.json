    "text_summary": "This passage discusses the superiority of Jesus Christ as the High Priest compared to the Levitical priests of the Old Covenant. It emphasizes Christ's holiness, sinlessness, and exaltation above the heavens. Unlike the Old Testament priests who had to offer sacrifices daily for their own sins and the sins of the people, Christ offered himself as a single, perfect sacrifice. The passage highlights the weakness of the Old Covenant and the establishment of a new and better covenant through Christ, based on better promises. God promises to write His laws on the hearts of believers, forgive their sins, and establish a new relationship with them. The passage concludes by describing the earthly tabernacle with its various components, symbolizing the heavenly reality. The obsolescence of the old covenant is emphasized."
