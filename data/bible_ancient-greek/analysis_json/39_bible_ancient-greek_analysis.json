    "text_summary": "This passage recounts several key events in Jesus' ministry. It begins with the raising of a girl from the dead, followed by Jesus commissioning the twelve apostles, giving them power over demons and disease, and sending them to preach the kingdom of God. Herod, the tetrarch, is perplexed by the reports of Jesus' miracles, wondering if he is John the Baptist resurrected. The apostles return and report their activities. Jesus feeds a multitude of five thousand people with only five loaves and two fish. He then asks his disciples who the crowds believe him to be, and Peter confesses that Jesus is the Christ. Jesus predicts his suffering, death, and resurrection. He teaches about self-denial and following him. Finally, Jesus takes Peter, John, and James to a mountain where he is transfigured, and Moses and Elijah appear."
