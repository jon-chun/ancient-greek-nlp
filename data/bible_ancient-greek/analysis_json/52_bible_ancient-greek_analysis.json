    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of Luke, based on the content and themes.",
    "text_summary": "This passage covers several distinct teachings and narratives. It begins with instructions on forgiveness, emphasizing unlimited forgiveness for a repentant brother. The apostles then ask for increased faith, and Jesus responds with the parable of the mustard seed, highlighting the power of even small faith. Next, the passage describes the duty of servants, illustrating that obedience is expected and does not warrant special thanks. The narrative shifts to the healing of ten lepers, where only one, a Samaritan, returns to give thanks. Jesus acknowledges the Samaritan's faith as having saved him. Finally, the passage addresses the coming of the Kingdom of God, stating it is not observable but within. It also warns about the suddenness of the Son of Man's return, comparing it to the days of Noah and Lot, and urges preparedness. The passage ends with parables on prayer, emphasizing persistence, and on humility versus self-righteousness, contrasting a Pharisee and a tax collector."
