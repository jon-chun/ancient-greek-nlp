    "text_summary": "This passage emphasizes God's choice of the weak and foolish to shame the wise and strong, so that no one can boast before Him. It highlights that believers are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption for them. The apostle Paul describes his own approach to preaching the Gospel, focusing not on eloquent words but on the demonstration of the Spirit and power, so that faith rests on God's power, not human wisdom. The passage then delves into true wisdom, which is God's hidden wisdom, revealed through the Spirit, contrasting it with the wisdom of the world's rulers, who crucified the Lord of glory. It concludes by addressing the Corinthians' immaturity, their divisions based on allegiance to different leaders, and their carnality, emphasizing that they are still infants in Christ, needing milk rather than solid food."
