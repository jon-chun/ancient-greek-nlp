    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely from one of the Gospels (possibly Luke), due to the presence of Jesus, Pharisees, Sabbath controversies, healing miracles, the calling of the twelve apostles, and the beginning of a sermon resembling the Sermon on the Mount.",
    "text_summary": "This passage recounts several events in the life and ministry of Jesus. It begins with a Sabbath controversy where Jesus' disciples are criticized for picking grain. Jesus defends their actions by referencing David's example. Another Sabbath scene follows, where Jesus heals a man with a withered hand, sparking further conflict with the Pharisees who seek to accuse him. Jesus then chooses twelve apostles. Finally, Jesus delivers a sermon, including blessings for the poor, hungry, and those who are persecuted, and woes to the rich. The passage highlights themes of Sabbath observance, divine authority, healing, discipleship, and the reversal of worldly values in God's kingdom."
