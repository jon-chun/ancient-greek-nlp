    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely from one of the Gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke, or John), specifically describing the arrest, trial, and Peter's denial of Jesus.",
    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the betrayal and arrest of Jesus, starting with Judas's kiss and the disciples' attempt to defend him, including one cutting off a servant's ear. Jesus is then taken to the high priest, where he is questioned and falsely accused. Peter follows at a distance and denies knowing Jesus three times. Jesus is silent before his accusers, but affirms his identity as the Christ, the Son of God. The high priest accuses him of blasphemy, and the council condemns him to death. The passage also describes the abuse Jesus endures, including spitting, blindfolding, and striking. The passage ends with the Jewish leaders binding Jesus and handing him over to Pilate, and Pilate questioning Jesus about being the King of the Jews."
