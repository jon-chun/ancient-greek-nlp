    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, specifically the Gospel of John, likely chapters 13-14, dealing with the Last Supper and Jesus's farewell discourse.",
    "text_summary": "This passage recounts Jesus washing the disciples' feet, a symbolic act of humility and service. Peter initially resists, but Jesus explains its importance for their relationship. Jesus then explains the significance of his actions, urging them to serve one another. He foretells Judas' betrayal, causing distress among the disciples. Jesus gives them a new commandment to love one another, emphasizing that their love will identify them as his followers. He predicts Peter's denial and comforts them by speaking of his departure to prepare a place for them, assuring them of his return. Thomas questions the way to this place, and Jesus declares himself to be the way, the truth, and the life, the only path to the Father. Phillip asks to see the Father, and Jesus explains that seeing him is seeing the Father. He promises that those who believe in him will do greater works and that he will answer their prayers."
