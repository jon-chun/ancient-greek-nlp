    "text_summary": "This passage contains two distinct but related teachings of Jesus. First, it addresses the Pharisees' spiritual blindness, stating that their claim to see makes their sin remain. Then, Jesus uses the allegory of the Good Shepherd and the sheepfold to illustrate his role as the true way to salvation and the protector of his followers. He contrasts himself with thieves and robbers who seek to harm the sheep. He emphasizes his intimate knowledge of and care for his sheep, even to the point of laying down his life for them. He also mentions other sheep not of this fold that he must bring in, leading to one flock and one shepherd. This teaching causes division among the Jews, with some accusing him of being demon-possessed and others recognizing the power of his words. The passage concludes with Jesus walking in the temple during the Feast of Dedication."
