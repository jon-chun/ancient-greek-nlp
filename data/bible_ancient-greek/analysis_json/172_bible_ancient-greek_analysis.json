    "text_summary": "This passage encourages believers to abandon malice and embrace spiritual nourishment. It speaks of Jesus as the living stone, rejected by humans but chosen by God, and believers as living stones built into a spiritual house. It emphasizes their identity as a chosen people, a royal priesthood, and a holy nation, called out of darkness into light. The passage urges them to abstain from fleshly lusts, maintain good conduct among Gentiles, and submit to earthly authorities. It also addresses the suffering of Christ as an example, and instructs wives to submit to their husbands and husbands to treat their wives with respect. Finally, it calls for unity, compassion, and humility among believers, urging them to bless rather than retaliate, and to sanctify Christ in their hearts, being ready to give an account of their hope."
