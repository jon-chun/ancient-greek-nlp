    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely from one of the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, or Luke). Based on the content, it includes teachings on marriage/divorce, blessing children, the rich young man, the difficulty of the rich entering the Kingdom of God, rewards for those who forsake all for Christ, and a prediction of Jesus's suffering and death.",
    "text_summary": "This passage covers several distinct teachings and events. Jesus discusses the sanctity of marriage, stating that what God has joined, no one should separate. He blesses children, emphasizing the importance of childlike faith for entering the Kingdom of God. A rich young man asks how to inherit eternal life, and Jesus instructs him to sell all his possessions and follow Him, but the man departs sorrowfully because he is very wealthy. Jesus then teaches about the difficulty of the rich entering the Kingdom of God, using the analogy of a camel passing through the eye of a needle. Peter points out that the disciples have left everything, and Jesus promises great rewards in this life and eternal life in the age to come. Finally, Jesus predicts his impending suffering, death, and resurrection in Jerusalem. James and John ask for positions of honor in his kingdom, leading to a lesson on true leadership through service. The passage concludes with the healing of blind Bartimaeus."
