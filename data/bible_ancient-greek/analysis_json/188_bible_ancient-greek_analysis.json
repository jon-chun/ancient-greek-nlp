    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the Book of Revelation in the New Testament. The text describes the opening of seals, each unleashing a different event or plague upon the earth, followed by visions of salvation and judgment.",
    "text_summary": "This passage from Revelation details the opening of the third through sixth seals. The third seal brings famine, with scarce resources being sold at high prices. The fourth seal unleashes Death, riding a pale horse, accompanied by Hades, who are given power to kill a quarter of the earth through war, famine, plague, and wild beasts. The fifth seal reveals the souls of martyrs under the altar, crying out for justice. They are given white robes and told to wait until the full number of martyrs is complete. The sixth seal causes a great earthquake, darkening the sun and moon, and causing stars to fall. People of all ranks hide in caves, fearing the wrath of God and the Lamb. Angels are then seen holding back the four winds, and another angel seals the servants of God on their foreheads. The passage concludes with a vision of a great multitude from all nations standing before the throne, praising God for salvation, and being comforted by God who will wipe away their tears."
