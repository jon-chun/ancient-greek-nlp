    "text_summary": "This segment from the Gospel of John contains Jesus's farewell discourse to his disciples before his crucifixion. He emphasizes the importance of loving him and keeping his commandments. He promises to send the Holy Spirit (the Paraclete) to be with them forever, a spirit of truth that the world cannot receive. Jesus assures them that he will not leave them as orphans and that they will see him again after a short time. He speaks of the intimate relationship between himself, the Father, and his followers, emphasizing that those who love him will be loved by the Father and that he will reveal himself to them. Judas (not Iscariot) questions why Jesus will reveal himself to them and not the world. Jesus explains that those who love him will keep his word, and the Father will love them and dwell with them. He contrasts this with those who do not love him and do not keep his words. Jesus speaks of peace he leaves with them, a peace unlike the world's. He reminds them of his departure and return and encourages them not to be troubled or afraid. He states that he will not speak much longer because the ruler of the world is coming but has no power over him. He emphasizes his love for the Father and his obedience to his commands. He uses the metaphor of the vine and the branches to illustrate the importance of remaining in him to bear fruit, stating that apart from him, they can do nothing. He explains that if they remain in him and his words remain in them, they can ask for whatever they wish, and it will be done. He calls them friends if they do what he commands and states that no one has greater love than to lay down their life for their friends. He commands them to love one another as he has loved them."
