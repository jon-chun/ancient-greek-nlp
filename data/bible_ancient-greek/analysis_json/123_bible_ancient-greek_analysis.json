He boasts about the Corinthians' eagerness to give and encourages them to be prepared when he arrives with Macedonians, lest they be embarrassed. Paul stresses the importance of generous giving, relating it to sowing and reaping, and affirms that God loves a cheerful giver. He assures them that God will provide for them so they can abound in good works, leading to thanksgiving to God. The passage concludes with Paul defending his authority and ministry against those who criticize him, asserting his strength in Christ and his commitment to building up the church rather than tearing it down. He emphasizes that true boasting should be in the Lord."
