    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely 2 Peter, based on the references to the transfiguration, prophetic word, false teachers, and judgment.",
    "text_summary": "This passage discusses the reliability of the prophetic word, affirmed by the eyewitness account of the transfiguration. It warns against false teachers who will introduce destructive heresies and deny Christ, leading many astray and blaspheming the truth. Their judgment is certain. The text uses examples of God's judgment on fallen angels, the ancient world (Noah's flood), and Sodom and Gomorrah to illustrate the fate of the ungodly. It contrasts this with God's ability to rescue the righteous, like Noah and Lot. The passage condemns those who indulge in lust, despise authority, and blaspheme what they do not understand, comparing them to irrational animals destined for destruction. They are characterized by greed, deceit, and a pursuit of pleasure, leading others into sin."
