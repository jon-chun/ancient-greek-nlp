    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely from one of the Gospels (possibly Luke), as it contains teachings and parables of Jesus, including a discussion about the resurrection, a question about the Messiah being David's son, warnings against the scribes, the story of the widow's offering, and a prophecy about the temple's destruction.",
    "text_summary": "This passage encompasses several distinct episodes and teachings. It begins with the Sadducees questioning Jesus about the resurrection, presenting a hypothetical scenario of a woman married to seven brothers. Jesus responds by explaining that marriage is irrelevant in the afterlife, as those resurrected are like angels and children of God. He further affirms the resurrection by referencing God's declaration to Moses as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The passage then shifts to Jesus questioning the scribes about the Messiah's relationship to David, challenging their understanding. Following this, Jesus warns his disciples about the hypocrisy and greed of the scribes. He then observes the offerings at the temple treasury, contrasting the wealthy's contributions with the widow's sacrificial gift. Finally, Jesus prophesies the destruction of the temple, leading to questions about the timing and signs of this event, and warns against deception and fear in the face of future tribulations, promising his followers wisdom and resilience. The passage concludes with a reminder of the persecution they will face and the importance of perseverance."
