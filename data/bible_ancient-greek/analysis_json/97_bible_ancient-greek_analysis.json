    "text_summary": "This passage explores the internal conflict between the desire to follow God's law and the inability to do so due to the presence of sin. It describes the struggle of the human condition, where even with good intentions, individuals find themselves acting against their will. The passage highlights the power of sin dwelling within, leading to a sense of helplessness and despair. However, it transitions to a message of hope and liberation through Jesus Christ. It emphasizes that through Christ, believers are freed from the law of sin and death by the law of the Spirit of life. The passage also contrasts living according to the flesh (carnal nature) with living according to the Spirit, emphasizing that those led by the Spirit are children of God and will experience life and peace. It concludes by stating that if the Spirit of God dwells in believers, they will be resurrected to eternal life."
