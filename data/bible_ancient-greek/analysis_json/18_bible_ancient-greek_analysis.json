    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely from the Gospel of Mark, containing teachings and interactions of Jesus.",
    "text_summary": "This passage contains several distinct episodes. It begins with Jesus affirming the greatest commandment: to love God with all one's being and to love one's neighbor as oneself. A scribe agrees, recognizing this is more important than sacrifices. Jesus commends the scribe, saying he is not far from the Kingdom of God. Jesus then challenges the scribes' understanding of the Messiah as David's son, quoting Psalm 110 to show the Messiah is also David's Lord. The crowd listens with delight. Jesus warns against the scribes' hypocrisy, their love of status and their exploitation of widows. He observes people giving to the temple treasury, noting that a poor widow's small offering is greater than the large gifts of the rich, because she gave all she had. Finally, Jesus predicts the destruction of the temple in response to a disciple's admiration of its grandeur. He then sits on the Mount of Olives and privately tells Peter, James, John, and Andrew about the signs that will precede the temple's destruction. He warns them not to be deceived."
