    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, specifically the Book of Hebrews. The references to Melchizedek and the discussion of priesthood are strong indicators.",
    "text_summary": "This passage from Hebrews encourages believers to persevere in their faith, reminding them that God is just and remembers their acts of love and service. It uses the example of Abraham, who patiently waited for God's promise and received it, confirmed by God's oath. God's unchanging purpose is emphasized, offering strong encouragement to those who have fled to Him for refuge. This hope is described as an anchor for the soul, secure and firm, reaching into the inner sanctuary where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek. The passage then delves into the significance of Melchizedek, highlighting his superiority to the Levitical priesthood and establishing Jesus's priesthood as superior and eternal, based on the power of an indestructible life, offering complete salvation to those who draw near to God through Him."
