    "text_summary": "This segment depicts a series of apocalyptic events. It describes a figure with a sharp sword who will strike the nations and rule with an iron rod, trampling the winepress of God's wrath. An angel calls birds to feast on the flesh of kings and armies defeated in a battle against the rider on the horse and his army. The beast and false prophet are captured and thrown into a lake of fire. The devil is bound for a thousand years, after which he is released and deceives the nations again, leading to a final battle and his ultimate defeat. The dead are judged according to their deeds, and a new heaven and earth are created, with the holy city of Jerusalem descending from God. Death and Hades are cast into the lake of fire, and only those written in the Book of Life enter the new creation."
