    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of Luke, given the content about Jesus healing people and teaching.",
    "text_summary": "This segment from the Gospel describes several events in Jesus' ministry. It begins with the healing of a leper, followed by Jesus' increasing fame and withdrawal for prayer. Then, it recounts the healing of a paralytic man lowered through a roof, where Jesus also forgives his sins, sparking controversy with the Pharisees and scribes. Jesus defends his authority to forgive sins by healing the man. The narrative continues with the calling of Levi (Matthew), a tax collector, and a meal Jesus shares with tax collectors and sinners, drawing criticism from the Pharisees. Jesus responds that he came to call sinners to repentance, not the righteous. Finally, the text addresses the question of fasting, contrasting Jesus' disciples with those of John and the Pharisees, and concludes with parables about new cloth on old garments and new wine in old wineskins, emphasizing the incompatibility of the old and new covenants."
