    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, specifically the Gospel of John, chapters 17 and 18. Chapter 17 contains Jesus's prayer for his disciples and future believers. Chapter 18 describes Jesus's betrayal and arrest.",
    "text_summary": "This passage encompasses Jesus's prayer to God for his disciples, emphasizing their separation from the world, their sanctification through truth, and their unity. Jesus also prays for future believers who will come to faith through the disciples' message, desiring that they all be one, as he and the Father are one. He expresses his love for them, mirroring the Father's love for him. The passage then shifts to the narrative of Jesus's betrayal by Judas, his arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane, and his initial interaction with the arresting soldiers. He identifies himself, causing them to fall back. He also protects his disciples, ensuring their safety as he faces his impending suffering. Peter's impulsive act of cutting off the ear of the high priest's servant is also described, followed by Jesus's rebuke and healing of the servant."
