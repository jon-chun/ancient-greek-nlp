    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely 1 Corinthians 15, discussing resurrection and the nature of the spiritual body.",
    "text_summary": "This passage contrasts the earthly (psychikon) and spiritual (pneumatikon) realms, asserting that the physical body is not the final form. It speaks of Adam as the first man, a living soul, and Christ as the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. The text emphasizes that the spiritual follows the physical, not precedes it. It highlights the difference between the earthly man and the heavenly man, urging believers to bear the image of the heavenly. It declares that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruption. A mystery is revealed: all will be changed, not necessarily die, at the last trumpet. The perishable must put on imperishability, and the mortal immortality. Death is swallowed up in victory, its sting (sin) and power (the law) overcome through Christ. The passage concludes with exhortations to steadfastness, diligence in the Lord's work, and instructions regarding a collection for the saints, travel plans, and greetings. It ends with a curse on those who do not love the Lord and a blessing of grace and love."
