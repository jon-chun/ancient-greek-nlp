    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, specifically dealing with the dragon, the beast, and their conflict with the woman and the saints.",
    "text_summary": "This passage describes a cosmic battle between good and evil. A woman, representing the people of God, is protected from a dragon (Satan) by the earth. The dragon, enraged, wages war against the remaining offspring of the woman, those who keep God's commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus. A beast emerges from the sea, possessing immense power and authority given to it by the dragon. The beast is worshipped, and its blasphemous pronouncements are heard. It is granted authority to make war against the saints and to conquer them. All those whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life will worship the beast. A call for endurance and faith is issued to the saints. Another beast arises from the earth, wielding the power of the first beast and compelling people to worship it."
