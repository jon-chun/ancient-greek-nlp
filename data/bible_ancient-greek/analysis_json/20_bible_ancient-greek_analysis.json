    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of Mark, containing passages about the coming of the Son of Man, parables about watchfulness, the Passover preparations, and the anointing of Jesus.",
    "text_summary": "This segment of the Gospel describes Jesus foretelling his return in glory, emphasizing the need for vigilance and readiness. It includes the parable of the fig tree as a sign of the approaching end times. It also speaks of the unknowable timing of this event, known only to God the Father. The passage transitions to the Passover preparations and Judas's betrayal plot. It recounts the story of a woman anointing Jesus with expensive perfume in Bethany, which draws criticism but is defended by Jesus as a prefigurement of his burial. Finally, Judas Iscariot agrees to betray Jesus to the chief priests for money, setting the stage for the Passion narrative. The overarching themes are the anticipation of Christ's return, the importance of watchfulness, the foreshadowing of Jesus's death and resurrection, and the betrayal that sets the Passion in motion."
