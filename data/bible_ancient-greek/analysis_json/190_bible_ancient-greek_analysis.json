    "text_summary": "This segment describes an angel proclaiming the end of time and the fulfillment of God's mystery. John is instructed to eat a scroll, which tastes sweet but turns bitter in his stomach, symbolizing the mixed experience of prophecy. He is then commanded to prophesy again to many nations. A measuring reed is given to him to measure the temple, altar, and worshippers, excluding the outer court which is given to the Gentiles who will trample the holy city for 42 months. God will empower two witnesses to prophesy for 1260 days, clothed in sackcloth. These witnesses have great power, able to shut the sky, turn water to blood, and strike the earth with plagues. The beast from the abyss will wage war against them, kill them, and their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified. After three and a half days, they will be resurrected, causing joy among those who dwell on the earth."
