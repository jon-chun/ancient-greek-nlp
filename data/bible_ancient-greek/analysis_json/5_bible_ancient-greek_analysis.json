    "text_summary": "This passage contains several distinct episodes. First, scribes accuse Jesus of being possessed by Beelzebul and casting out demons by the power of the prince of demons. Jesus refutes this claim with parables, arguing that Satan would not cast out Satan. He warns against blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, stating it is an unforgivable sin. Then, Jesus's mother and brothers arrive, but he declares that his true family are those who do the will of God. Finally, Jesus begins teaching by the sea, using the parable of the sower to illustrate how different people respond to the word of God. He explains the parable to his disciples, emphasizing that understanding is given to them but hidden from outsiders. He concludes with sayings about light, hearing, and the kingdom of God."
