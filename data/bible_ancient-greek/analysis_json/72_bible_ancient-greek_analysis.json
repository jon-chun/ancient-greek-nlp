    "text_summary": "This passage describes Jesus teaching in the temple during a festival. He proclaims his divine origin and connection to God, which sparks controversy among the crowd. Some believe in him, while others question his origins, leading to division. The Pharisees and chief priests attempt to arrest him, but are unsuccessful. Jesus speaks of his impending departure and the inability of his opponents to follow him, leading to further confusion and debate among the Jewish people. He offers living water to those who believe in him, referring to the Holy Spirit. The passage ends with the Pharisees questioning their officers as to why they did not arrest Jesus, and Nicodemus defends Jesus's right to a fair hearing."
