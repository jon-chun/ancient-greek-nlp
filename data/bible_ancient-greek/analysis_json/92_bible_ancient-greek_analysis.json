    "text_summary": "This segment is the opening of Paul's letter to the Romans. He identifies himself as a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, set apart for the gospel of God, which was promised through the prophets. He speaks of Jesus as the Son of God, descended from David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection. He emphasizes that through Jesus, he received grace and apostleship to bring about obedience of faith among all nations. He expresses his gratitude to God for the faith of the Roman believers, which is proclaimed throughout the world. He longs to visit them to impart spiritual gifts for their strengthening and mutual encouragement. Finally, Paul declares that he is not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, both Jew and Gentile, revealing God's righteousness through faith. The wrath of God is revealed against unrighteousness."
