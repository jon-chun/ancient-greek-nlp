    "text_summary": "This text segment presents two distinct parables. The first is the Parable of the Prodigal Son, where a son squanders his inheritance and returns home repentant. His father welcomes him back with immense joy, celebrating his return from being \"dead\" and \"lost.\" The elder brother resents this celebration, highlighting themes of forgiveness, repentance, and sibling rivalry. The second parable is that of the Unjust Steward, who, facing dismissal, cunningly reduces the debts of his master's debtors to secure future favor. This parable explores themes of shrewdness, resourcefulness, and the use of worldly wealth for spiritual gain. The segment emphasizes God's forgiveness and the importance of using one's resources wisely."
