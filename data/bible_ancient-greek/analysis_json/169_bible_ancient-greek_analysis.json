    "text_summary": "This passage emphasizes the importance of righteous living and warns against hypocrisy. It urges believers to control their anger, rid themselves of moral filth, and humbly receive God's word. It highlights the necessity of being doers of the word, not just hearers, and warns against self-deception. True religion is defined as caring for the vulnerable (orphans and widows) and keeping oneself unstained by the world. The passage also condemns favoritism towards the rich and disrespect towards the poor, reminding believers that God has chosen the poor to be rich in faith. It stresses the importance of keeping the whole law and warns that even a single transgression makes one guilty of breaking it all. Finally, it addresses the futility of faith without works, using the example of providing empty words instead of practical help to the needy."
