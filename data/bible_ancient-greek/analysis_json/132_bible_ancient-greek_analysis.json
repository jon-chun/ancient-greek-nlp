    "text_summary": "This passage from Ephesians describes the transformative power of God's grace through Jesus Christ. It speaks of humanity's previous state as spiritually dead, enslaved to sin and worldly influences, and subject to God's wrath. However, God, rich in mercy and love, made believers alive together with Christ, saving them by grace. This salvation is not earned through works but is a gift from God, preventing boasting. Believers are now God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works. The passage also addresses the reconciliation between Jews and Gentiles through Christ, who broke down the dividing wall of hostility and created one new humanity. Through Christ, both groups have access to the Father in one Spirit, becoming fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ as the cornerstone."
