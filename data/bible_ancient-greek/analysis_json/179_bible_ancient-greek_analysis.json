    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely from one of the Johannine epistles (1 John, 2 John, or 3 John), given the themes of love, obedience, and distinguishing between truth and falsehood.",
    "text_summary": "This passage emphasizes the importance of love for one another as a sign of being children of God and distinguishes them from children of the devil. It highlights that those who do not practice righteousness or love their brothers are not of God. The passage refers to the story of Cain and Abel as an example of hatred leading to murder. It encourages believers not to be surprised by the world's hatred and asserts that love for one another signifies a transition from death to life. Hatred is equated with murder, and the passage emphasizes that murderers do not have eternal life. It calls believers to lay down their lives for one another, following Christ's example. It also addresses the importance of showing love in action and truth, not just in word. The passage discusses the assurance of being in truth and having confidence before God through obedience to His commandments, which include believing in Jesus Christ and loving one another. It warns against believing every spirit and encourages testing the spirits to discern whether they are from God, identifying the spirit of God as that which confesses Jesus Christ come in the flesh. The passage concludes by asserting that believers are of God and have overcome the world because the one within them is greater than the one in the world, and that those who are of God listen to the apostles' teachings, distinguishing them from those who are not of God and follow the spirit of error. God is love, and love is a manifestation of God."
