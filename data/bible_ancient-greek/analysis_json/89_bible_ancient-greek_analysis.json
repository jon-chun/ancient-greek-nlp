    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the events following Jesus' resurrection. Mary Magdalene discovers the empty tomb and encounters Jesus, initially mistaking him for a gardener. Upon recognizing him, she proclaims his resurrection to the disciples. Later, Jesus appears to the disciples, even though the doors are locked, and offers them peace. He shows them his wounds as proof. He commissions them to continue his work, granting them the power to forgive sins. Thomas, initially absent, doubts the resurrection until Jesus appears again and invites him to touch his wounds. Thomas then proclaims Jesus as Lord and God. Jesus blesses those who believe without seeing. The passage concludes by stating that these signs are written so that people may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and have life through his name."
