    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely from the Gospel of Luke, specifically the account of the resurrection of Jesus and the encounter on the road to Emmaus.",
    "text_summary": "This passage describes the discovery of Jesus' empty tomb by women who had come to anoint his body with spices. They are met by angels who announce that Jesus has risen. The women report this to the apostles, who initially disbelieve them. Peter investigates and finds the tomb empty. The passage then shifts to the story of two disciples walking to Emmaus, who are joined by the resurrected Jesus, though they do not recognize him. He explains the scriptures to them, and they finally recognize him when he breaks bread with them. The overall theme is the resurrection of Jesus, the initial disbelief of the disciples, and the gradual revelation of Jesus' identity to his followers."
