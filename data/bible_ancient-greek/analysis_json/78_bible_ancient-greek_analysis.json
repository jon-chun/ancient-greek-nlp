    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. Martha and Mary grieve the death of their brother Lazarus. Jesus arrives and assures Martha that Lazarus will rise again. He declares himself the resurrection and the life, emphasizing that those who believe in him will live even after death. Mary then arrives, expressing her sorrow. Jesus, deeply moved by their grief, asks where Lazarus is buried. He goes to the tomb, commands the stone to be removed, and prays to God. Then, with a loud voice, he calls Lazarus forth, and Lazarus emerges from the tomb, still bound. Jesus instructs the people to unbind him. Many Jews who witnessed this miracle believe in Jesus, while others report it to the Pharisees."
