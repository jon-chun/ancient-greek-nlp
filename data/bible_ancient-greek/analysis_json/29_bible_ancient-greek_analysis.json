    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the birth of Jesus Christ. An angel announces to shepherds the birth of the savior in Bethlehem. The shepherds find baby Jesus in a manger, as foretold. They spread the word, and all who hear are amazed. Mary treasures these events. The shepherds return glorifying God. The passage also describes Jesus' circumcision and presentation at the temple in Jerusalem. Simeon and Anna, righteous individuals, recognize Jesus as the Messiah. Simeon blesses Jesus and prophesies about his destiny. Anna also speaks about Jesus to those awaiting redemption. Finally, it describes Jesus's childhood and a visit to Jerusalem when he was twelve years old, where he astounds the teachers with his understanding."
