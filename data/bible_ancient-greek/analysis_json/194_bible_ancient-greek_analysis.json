    "text_summary": "This segment from Revelation describes a series of apocalyptic events. Angels are commanded to reap the earth, both in terms of a harvest and a grape harvest, which results in a great winepress of God's wrath, filled with blood. Following this, seven angels appear with seven plagues, signifying the completion of God's wrath. The scene shifts to those victorious over the beast praising God. Then, the temple opens, and angels emerge with vials of God's wrath, which they pour onto the earth, causing sores, the sea turning to blood, rivers turning to blood, scorching heat, darkness, and the drying up of the Euphrates. Unclean spirits gather the kings for battle at Armageddon. The seventh angel pours his vial into the air, causing a great earthquake, the destruction of cities, and a great hailstorm."
