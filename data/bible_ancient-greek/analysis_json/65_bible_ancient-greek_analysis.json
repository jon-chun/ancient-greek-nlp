    "text_summary": "This segment recounts several episodes in the life of Jesus. It begins with the wedding at Cana, where Jesus transforms water into wine, demonstrating his power and initiating his public ministry. He then travels to Capernaum and subsequently goes to Jerusalem for Passover. In the temple, he drives out merchants and money changers, declaring it a house of prayer, not commerce. This act prompts questions about his authority, and he alludes to his resurrection. The passage then describes Jesus' encounter with Nicodemus, a Pharisee, at night. Jesus teaches Nicodemus about the necessity of being \"born again\" through water and the Spirit to enter the kingdom of God. He speaks of his own role as the Son of Man who must be lifted up, like Moses lifted up the serpent, so that those who believe in him may have eternal life. The text emphasizes God's love for the world, demonstrated by sending his Son, not to condemn the world, but to save it. It concludes with Jesus and his disciples going to Judea to baptize."
