    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely from one of Paul's letters, specifically dealing with the resurrection of Christ and its implications.",
    "text_summary": "This passage discusses the resurrection of Christ as the foundation of Christian hope. It argues that if Christ had not been raised, then believers are to be pitied. However, Christ *has* been raised, making him the firstfruits of those who have died. Death came through Adam, but resurrection comes through Christ. All will be made alive in Christ, each in their own order: Christ first, then those who belong to him at his coming. Christ will reign until he has put all enemies under his feet, the last enemy being death itself. Eventually, even Christ will be subject to God, so that God may be all in all. The passage then questions the practice of baptism for the dead if the dead are not raised. Paul affirms his own daily facing of death for the sake of the gospel. It warns against being deceived and encourages righteous living, as some are ignorant of God. Finally, it addresses the question of how the dead are raised and with what kind of body, using the analogy of a seed that must die to produce a new plant, and explaining the different kinds of bodies, both earthly and heavenly, culminating in the description of the resurrected body as imperishable, glorious, powerful, and spiritual."
