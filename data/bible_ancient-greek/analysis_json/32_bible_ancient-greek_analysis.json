    "text_summary": "This passage recounts Jesus' rejection in his hometown and his subsequent ministry in Capernaum and Galilee. It begins with Jesus referencing the prophets Elijah and Elisha, who performed miracles for non-Israelites, implying that prophets are not always accepted in their own communities. This incites anger among the people, who attempt to kill him. Jesus escapes and goes to Capernaum, where he teaches with authority and casts out an unclean spirit. News of his power spreads. He heals Simon's mother-in-law and many others. He then explains that he must preach the Kingdom of God in other cities. Finally, the passage describes Jesus calling Simon (Peter) and other fishermen to become his disciples after a miraculous catch of fish. This highlights themes of rejection, divine authority, healing, the spread of the gospel, and the calling of disciples."
