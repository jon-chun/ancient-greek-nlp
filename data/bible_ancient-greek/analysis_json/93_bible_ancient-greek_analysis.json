    "text_summary": "This passage describes the consequences of rejecting God and turning to idolatry and immorality. It argues that people are without excuse because God's existence is evident through creation. Those who reject God become vain in their thinking and darkened in their understanding, exchanging the glory of God for images of created things. This leads to God giving them over to their sinful desires, resulting in sexual immorality and other vices. The passage condemns those who practice such things and also those who approve of them. Furthermore, it warns against judging others, as those who judge are often guilty of the same sins. It emphasizes that God's judgment is based on truth and that He will repay each person according to their deeds, offering eternal life to those who seek Him through good works, but wrath and fury to those who are self-seeking and disobedient. God shows no partiality."
