    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of Mark, based on the content about Jesus performing miracles, questioning his disciples, Peter's confession, and the transfiguration.",
    "text_summary": "This segment from the Gospel describes several events. Jesus reminds his disciples of past miracles (feeding the multitudes) to highlight their lack of understanding. He heals a blind man in stages, symbolizing spiritual insight. Jesus then travels to Caesarea Philippi, where Peter confesses Jesus as the Christ. Jesus predicts his suffering, death, and resurrection, which Peter rebukes, leading to Jesus's strong rebuke of Peter. Jesus teaches about self-denial, taking up one's cross, and the value of the soul. He speaks of the coming Kingdom of God. Finally, Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James, and John, with Moses and Elijah appearing, and a voice from heaven affirms Jesus as the beloved Son. The disciples are commanded to keep the transfiguration a secret until after the resurrection. The passage concludes with a discussion about Elijah's coming and the healing of a boy with an unclean spirit."
