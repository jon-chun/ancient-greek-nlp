    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the final moments of Jesus's crucifixion, including his declaration \"It is finished,\" his death, and the piercing of his side. It details the Jewish leaders' concern about the bodies remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath and their request to Pilate to have the legs broken. The soldiers, however, did not break Jesus's legs as they found him already dead. Joseph of Arimathea, with Pilate's permission, retrieves Jesus's body and, together with Nicodemus, prepares it for burial with spices. They place the body in a new tomb in a garden near the crucifixion site. On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene discovers the empty tomb and informs Peter and the other disciple, who run to the tomb and find it empty, with only the burial cloths remaining. Mary Magdalene then remains at the tomb weeping and encounters two angels. The disciples then return home, pondering the events."
