    "text_summary": "This passage from Revelation describes a scene of worship and divine judgment. It begins with continuous praise of God, the Almighty, who was, is, and is to come. The living creatures give glory to God, prompting the elders to fall down in worship, casting their crowns before the throne. They declare God worthy to receive glory, honor, and power because He created all things. John sees a sealed book in God's right hand and a strong angel proclaims who is worthy to open it. John weeps because no one is found worthy, but one of the elders tells him that the Lion of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed. John then sees a Lamb standing as though slain, with seven horns and seven eyes, who takes the book from God's right hand. The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders worship the Lamb, holding harps and bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. They sing a new song, declaring the Lamb worthy to take the book and open its seals because He was slain and has redeemed people from every tribe and nation to be a kingdom and priests to God. Angels proclaim the Lamb worthy of power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing. Every creature in heaven, on earth, and under the earth joins in praising God and the Lamb. The four living creatures say \"Amen,\" and the elders fall down and worship. The Lamb then opens one of the seven seals, and one of the four living creatures calls out, \"Come!\" A white horse appears, and its rider is given a crown and goes out conquering. When the second seal is opened, a red horse appears, and its rider is given power to take peace from the earth, so that people will kill each other. He is given a large sword. When the third seal is opened, a black horse appears, and its rider has a pair of scales in his hand. A voice announces a measure of wheat for a day's wages."
