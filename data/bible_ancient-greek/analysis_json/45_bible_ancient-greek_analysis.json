    "text_summary": "This passage from the Gospels contains several teachings of Jesus. It begins with the parable of the rich fool who hoards his wealth and is rebuked by God. Jesus then instructs his disciples not to worry about material needs like food and clothing, pointing to the birds and lilies as examples of God's provision. He urges them to seek God's kingdom above all else and promises that their needs will be met. He encourages them not to fear, for the Father is pleased to give them the kingdom. He calls them to sell their possessions and give to the poor, storing up treasure in heaven. They are told to be ready for the Lord's return, like servants waiting for their master. The passage concludes with Jesus speaking about division and judgment, indicating that his coming will bring conflict and separation, and urging people to discern the signs of the times and reconcile with their adversaries. Finally, there is a brief account of Galileans being killed by Pilate."
