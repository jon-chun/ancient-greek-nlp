    "text_summary": "This text segment warns against false teachers and their destructive behaviors, contrasting them with righteous figures like Michael the Archangel and Enoch. It describes the corrupt individuals as those who defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme. They are likened to Cain, Balaam, and Korah, and are portrayed as blemishes, waterless clouds, fruitless trees, and wandering stars destined for darkness. The segment includes a prophecy of judgment by Enoch against the ungodly. It urges believers to remember the apostles' warnings about scoffers in the last days and to build themselves up in faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, and awaiting eternal life. It also contains the opening verses of the Book of Revelation, describing its purpose as a revelation from God through Jesus Christ to his servants, delivered by an angel to John. It emphasizes the importance of heeding the words of prophecy."
