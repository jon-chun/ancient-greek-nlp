    "text_summary": "This passage recounts several miraculous events performed by Jesus. First, Jesus casts out demons from a man into a herd of pigs, which then rush into the sea and drown. The people are amazed but also afraid and ask Jesus to leave. Next, Jesus returns across the sea and is met by Jairus, a synagogue leader, whose daughter is dying. While on the way to heal her, a woman who has suffered from bleeding for twelve years touches Jesus' cloak and is instantly healed. Jesus identifies her, and she confesses. He assures her that her faith has made her well. Messengers then arrive, announcing Jairus' daughter's death, but Jesus encourages Jairus to believe. Arriving at Jairus' house, Jesus raises the girl from the dead, instructing them to keep it secret and give her something to eat. Finally, Jesus returns to his hometown and teaches in the synagogue, astonishing the people with his wisdom and power."
