    "text_summary": "This passage recounts events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion. The Jewish leaders, concerned about Jesus' growing popularity and the potential Roman response, plot to kill him. Caiaphas, the high priest, unwittingly prophesies Jesus' death for the nation. Jesus withdraws temporarily. Before Passover, many travel to Jerusalem to purify themselves. Jesus arrives in Bethany six days before Passover, where he is honored at a dinner. Mary anoints Jesus with expensive perfume, prompting Judas' hypocritical complaint. A large crowd comes to see Jesus and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead. The chief priests then plot to kill Lazarus as well. The next day, Jesus triumphantly enters Jerusalem, greeted by a large crowd waving palm branches. Some Greeks seek to meet Jesus, and Jesus speaks about his impending glorification through death."
