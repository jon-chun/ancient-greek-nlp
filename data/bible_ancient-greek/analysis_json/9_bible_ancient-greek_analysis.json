    "text_summary": "The text recounts the beheading of John the Baptist at the request of Herodias' daughter, followed by his disciples burying him. The apostles then return to Jesus and report their activities. Jesus invites them to rest in a solitary place because of the overwhelming crowds. They depart by boat to a deserted area, but the crowds follow on foot. Jesus, moved with compassion for the multitude who are like sheep without a shepherd, begins to teach them. As evening approaches, the disciples suggest sending the people away to find food. Jesus instructs them to feed the crowd themselves. The disciples question how they could possibly feed so many with only five loaves and two fish. Jesus then miraculously feeds the five thousand, and twelve baskets of leftovers are collected."
