    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the announcements of the births of John the Baptist and Jesus. Zechariah, a priest, is visited by the angel Gabriel who tells him that his wife Elizabeth will conceive a son, John, who will prepare the way for the Lord. Zechariah doubts and is struck mute until John's birth. The passage then describes Gabriel's visit to Mary in Nazareth, where he announces that she will conceive Jesus, the Son of God. Mary questions how this is possible, and Gabriel explains that the Holy Spirit will come upon her. He also tells her about Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy. Mary accepts the announcement. The passage emphasizes divine intervention, faith, and the fulfillment of God's promises."
