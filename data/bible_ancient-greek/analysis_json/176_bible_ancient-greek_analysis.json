    "text_summary": "This passage warns against false teachers who have strayed from the truth and are leading others astray through their immoral behavior and empty promises. It references the story of Balaam as an example of someone who loved the wages of wickedness. The passage emphasizes that those who escape the corruption of the world through the knowledge of Jesus Christ but then become entangled in it again are in a worse state than before. It reminds believers of the prophecies and commandments they have received and warns of scoffers who will deny the promise of Christ's return, questioning where the promised coming is. The passage affirms that God is patient, desiring all to come to repentance, but the day of the Lord will come unexpectedly. Believers are encouraged to live holy and godly lives, looking forward to the new heavens and new earth where righteousness dwells."
