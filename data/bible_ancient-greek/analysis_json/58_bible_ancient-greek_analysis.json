    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely from the Gospel of Luke, specifically dealing with Jesus's teachings about the destruction of Jerusalem and the coming of the Son of Man. It also includes the parable of the fig tree and warnings about being prepared for the end times, as well as the beginning of the Passion narrative with Judas's betrayal.",
    "text_summary": "This passage contains Jesus's prophecy about the destruction of Jerusalem, urging his followers to flee to the mountains when they see the city surrounded by armies. He warns of great distress and tribulation, with Jerusalem being trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. Signs in the heavens and on earth will precede the coming of the Son of Man in power and glory. He encourages his followers to be watchful and pray for strength to escape the coming calamities. Jesus uses the parable of the fig tree to illustrate the nearness of these events. He warns against being weighed down by worldly cares and urges vigilance. The passage concludes with Jesus teaching in the temple during the day and spending the nights on the Mount of Olives, with the people coming early to hear him. It then transitions to the plot by the chief priests and scribes to kill him, and Satan entering Judas Iscariot, who agrees to betray Jesus."
