    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of Mark, specifically dealing with Jesus healing a possessed boy, teaching his disciples, and discussing his upcoming death and resurrection. It also includes teachings on humility and welcoming others.",
    "text_summary": "This passage recounts Jesus healing a boy possessed by a spirit that causes seizures. The disciples were unable to cast out the spirit, leading Jesus to express frustration with their lack of faith. After healing the boy, Jesus explains to his disciples that some spirits can only be cast out through prayer. The passage then shifts to Jesus foretelling his death and resurrection, which the disciples fail to understand. Later, in Capernaum, Jesus teaches about humility, stating that the greatest must be the servant of all and welcoming children in his name is welcoming him. The passage concludes with Jesus teaching about avoiding causing others to sin, emphasizing the importance of self-discipline and the dire consequences of leading others astray. He also stresses the importance of peace among believers. Finally, he discusses divorce with the Pharisees, emphasizing the original intent of marriage."
