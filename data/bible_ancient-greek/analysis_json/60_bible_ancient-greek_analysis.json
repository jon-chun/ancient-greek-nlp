    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely from one of the Gospels, specifically dealing with the arrest, trial, and denial of Jesus. Luke's Gospel is the most probable source.",
    "text_summary": "This passage recounts several key events surrounding Jesus's arrest and the immediate aftermath. It begins with Jesus rebuking his disciples for sleeping and warning them to pray to avoid temptation. Judas betrays Jesus with a kiss. One of Jesus's followers wounds a servant of the high priest, but Jesus heals him. Jesus is then arrested by the temple guards and taken to the high priest's house, while Peter follows at a distance. Inside the courtyard, Peter denies knowing Jesus three times, culminating in the rooster's crow and Jesus's gaze. The guards mock and beat Jesus. The Jewish leaders then bring Jesus before Pilate, accusing him of misleading the nation, forbidding the payment of taxes to Caesar, and claiming to be a king. Pilate questions Jesus, then sends him to Herod. Herod mocks Jesus and sends him back to Pilate. Pilate declares Jesus innocent but ultimately yields to the crowd's demand to release Barabbas and crucify Jesus."
