    "text_summary": "This passage describes the vision of the New Jerusalem, a heavenly city prepared as a bride for her husband (God/Christ). God dwells with humanity, ending suffering and death. He declares that He is making all things new and that His words are trustworthy. He identifies Himself as the Alpha and Omega, offering living water freely to the thirsty and promising inheritance to the victorious, becoming their God and they His children. However, the cowardly, unbelieving, and wicked will face eternal punishment in the lake of fire. An angel shows the speaker the New Jerusalem, descending from heaven, filled with God's glory, having high walls, twelve gates named after the tribes of Israel, and foundations named after the apostles. The city is square, with immense dimensions, built of precious stones and gold. There is no temple, as God and the Lamb are its temple. The city needs no sun or moon, for God's glory illuminates it. Nations will walk in its light, and kings will bring their glory into it. Nothing impure will enter the city."
