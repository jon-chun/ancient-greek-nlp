    "text_summary": "This passage contains several interconnected themes. It begins with Jesus speaking about the necessity of his death and resurrection, using the analogy of a grain of wheat. He emphasizes the importance of loving God more than one's own life and serving him. Jesus then expresses his inner turmoil about the impending hour of his suffering, but resolves to glorify God's name. A voice from heaven affirms God's glory. Jesus interprets this event as a judgment on the world and the casting out of its ruler (Satan). He speaks of being lifted up (crucified) and drawing all people to himself. The crowd questions this, citing the law that the Messiah will remain forever. Jesus urges them to believe in the light while they have it. The passage then describes Jesus performing many signs, yet the people still did not believe. This fulfills a prophecy of Isaiah. Some leaders believed but didn't confess it publicly for fear of the Pharisees. Jesus proclaims that believing in him is believing in God who sent him, and seeing him is seeing God. He came as light into the world to save it, not to judge it. He speaks the Father's words, which are eternal life. The passage concludes with the beginning of the Passover feast, Jesus knowing his hour has come to return to the Father, and his love for his disciples. He washes their feet, knowing Judas will betray him."
