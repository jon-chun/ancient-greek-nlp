    "text_summary": "This passage from the Gospel of Mark begins with the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ and a reference to Isaiah's prophecy about preparing the way for the Lord. It describes John the Baptist's ministry of baptizing people in the wilderness for repentance and forgiveness of sins. People from Judea and Jerusalem confessed their sins and were baptized by him in the Jordan River. John's appearance and diet are described, and he proclaims that one more powerful than he is coming, who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. Jesus is then baptized by John in the Jordan, and the Holy Spirit descends upon him like a dove, with a voice from heaven declaring him God's beloved Son. The Spirit immediately drives Jesus into the wilderness, where he is tempted by Satan for forty days. After John's arrest, Jesus begins preaching in Galilee, proclaiming the arrival of God's kingdom and calling people to repent and believe the gospel. He calls Simon, Andrew, James, and John to follow him and become fishers of men. Jesus then enters Capernaum and teaches in the synagogue on the Sabbath, astonishing the people with his authority. He casts out an unclean spirit from a man in the synagogue."
