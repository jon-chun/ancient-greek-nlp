    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of John, specifically a passage discussing Jesus's journey to Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles (Skenopygia), and the subsequent debates and teachings in the temple.",
    "text_summary": "This passage recounts Jesus's interactions with his brothers and the Jewish people in Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles. His brothers urge him to go to Judea to display his works openly. Jesus initially declines, stating that his time has not yet come, while their time is always right. He explains that the world hates him because he testifies that its works are evil. After his brothers leave for the feast, Jesus goes secretly. The Jewish people search for him and debate his identity, with some believing he is good and others claiming he deceives the crowd. Jesus begins teaching in the temple, astonishing the Jews with his knowledge. He explains that his teaching is not his own but comes from God, and that those who seek God's will shall recognize this. He also confronts them about their failure to keep the law of Moses and their desire to kill him, which they deny. Jesus then defends his healing on the Sabbath by referencing their practice of circumcision on the Sabbath. The people are divided and question if he is the Christ."
