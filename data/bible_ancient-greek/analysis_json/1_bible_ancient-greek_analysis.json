    "text_summary": "This text segment encompasses a wide range of narratives and teachings central to the Gospel of Matthew. It begins with the genealogy of Jesus, establishing his lineage. The narrative then shifts to the birth of Jesus, the visit of the Magi, and Herod's attempt to kill the infants in Bethlehem. John the Baptist's ministry and Jesus' baptism are described, followed by the temptation in the wilderness. Jesus begins his public ministry, calling disciples, performing miracles, and teaching through parables. Key teachings include the Sermon on the Mount, emphasizing love, forgiveness, and righteous living. The text also covers various miracles, demonstrating Jesus' divine power. The segment culminates with Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, his betrayal by Judas, arrest, trial before Pilate, crucifixion, death, and resurrection. The Great Commission tasks the disciples with spreading the Gospel to all nations."
