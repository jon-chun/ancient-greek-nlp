    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely from the Gospel of Luke, based on the parables, woes to the Pharisees and lawyers, and teachings about hypocrisy, confession, and stewardship.",
    "text_summary": "This passage contains several distinct teachings and narratives. First, Jesus contrasts the present generation with those who heeded wisdom in the past (Queen of Sheba and Solomon, Ninevites and Jonah). He then speaks about inner light and darkness, urging listeners to ensure their inner light isn't darkness. Next, a Pharisee is surprised that Jesus doesn't ritually wash before eating, prompting Jesus to denounce the Pharisees' hypocrisy, focusing on outward cleanliness while their hearts are full of greed and wickedness. He also condemns their love of honor and their neglect of justice and love of God. Jesus then rebukes the lawyers for burdening people with impossible laws and for honoring prophets their ancestors killed. He warns of judgment for the blood of the prophets shed from the beginning of the world. He criticizes the lawyers for taking away the key of knowledge. After this, the scribes and Pharisees try to trap Jesus with his words. Finally, Jesus warns his disciples about the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, emphasizing that all hidden things will be revealed. He urges them not to fear those who can only kill the body, but to fear God. He assures them that they are valued and encourages them to confess him before others. He teaches about blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. He instructs them not to worry about what to say when brought before authorities, for the Holy Spirit will guide them. He then addresses a request to divide an inheritance, warning against greed and telling a parable about a rich man who hoards his wealth, only to die suddenly."
