    "text_summary": "This passage encourages perseverance in faith, even in the face of suffering and opposition. It reminds believers of the example of Christ, who endured great hostility. It emphasizes that trials and discipline are signs of God's love and are meant to refine and train believers, leading to righteousness and peace. The passage contrasts the terrifying experience of Mount Sinai with the access believers now have to Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, and the presence of God, angels, and the spirits of the righteous. It warns against rejecting God's grace, using Esau as an example of someone who forfeited his inheritance. The passage concludes by urging believers to heed the better covenant established through Jesus."
