    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, specifically 1 Corinthians, chapters 5-7.",
    "text_summary": "This passage addresses issues of sexual immorality within the Corinthian church, instructing them to discipline a member involved in incest. It emphasizes the need for purity and warns against associating with immoral individuals, even those claiming to be believers. The text uses the analogy of leaven to illustrate how sin can corrupt the entire community. It also discusses the importance of sexual purity, highlighting that the body is meant for the Lord and is a temple of the Holy Spirit. It then transitions to addressing questions about marriage and celibacy, advising individuals to remain as they are, but acknowledging that marriage is preferable to burning with passion. It emphasizes mutual respect and responsibility within marriage, discouraging separation."
