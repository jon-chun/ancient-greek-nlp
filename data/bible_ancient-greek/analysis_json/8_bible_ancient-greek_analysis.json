    "text_summary": "This passage recounts Jesus' rejection in his hometown, where people questioned his origins despite his wisdom and miracles. Unable to perform many miracles there due to their lack of faith, he then sends out the twelve disciples in pairs, giving them authority over unclean spirits and instructing them to travel light, relying on hospitality. They preach repentance, cast out demons, and heal the sick. The passage then shifts to Herod's reaction to Jesus' growing fame, with some speculating that he is John the Baptist resurrected. The narrative then recounts how Herod had John imprisoned and ultimately beheaded at the request of Herodias' daughter, driven by Herodias' grudge against John for condemning her marriage to Herod."
