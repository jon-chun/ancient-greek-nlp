    "text_summary": "This passage explores the contrast between the seen and unseen, the temporal and eternal. It speaks of earthly bodies being temporary dwellings that will be replaced by eternal, heavenly ones. There is a sense of longing for this heavenly dwelling and a desire to be clothed in immortality, escaping the burden of mortality. God has prepared believers for this transformation and given the Holy Spirit as a guarantee. The passage emphasizes living by faith, not by sight, and striving to please God. It highlights the coming judgment before Christ, where everyone will be judged for their deeds. The love of Christ compels believers to live for Him, who died and rose again for them. In Christ, there is a new creation, and God reconciles the world to Himself through Christ, entrusting believers with the ministry of reconciliation. Believers are urged to be reconciled to God and not receive His grace in vain, emphasizing the present opportunity for salvation. The passage concludes with a description of the hardships endured by ministers of God, showcasing their dedication and resilience in the face of adversity."
