    "text_summary": "This passage from Luke describes Jesus' preparation for and celebration of the Passover meal with his disciples, including instructions for its preparation and his declaration that this would be his last Passover before the Kingdom of God is fulfilled. He institutes the Eucharist, offering bread as his body and wine as his blood of the new covenant. Jesus then predicts his betrayal and the disciples argue about who is the greatest among them. He teaches them about true leadership through service. He warns Peter of his denial. Jesus then speaks of the coming trials and tells them to prepare, even to buy swords. Finally, he goes to the Mount of Olives to pray, anticipating his suffering, and asks God to take the cup from him, but ultimately submits to God's will. He finds his disciples sleeping."
