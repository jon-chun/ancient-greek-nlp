    "text_identification": "This appears to be a segment from the New Testament, likely from one of Paul's epistles, given the style and themes discussed. Based on the content, it is likely from Ephesians 4:17-5:2.",
    "text_summary": "This passage contrasts the behavior of Gentiles, who are described as living in futility, darkened in their understanding, and alienated from God's life due to ignorance and hardness of heart, with the new life believers have in Christ. It urges believers to put off their old selves, which are corrupt according to deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of their minds, putting on the new self, created after God in righteousness and holiness. The text encourages truthfulness, righteous anger, avoiding giving the devil a foothold, honest labor, edifying speech, and avoiding grieving the Holy Spirit. It calls for kindness, tenderheartedness, and forgiveness, imitating God and walking in love as Christ loved us and gave himself up as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. It condemns sexual immorality, impurity, greed, and coarse jesting, and warns against being deceived by empty words, as God's wrath comes upon the disobedient. Believers are exhorted to walk as children of light, discerning what is pleasing to the Lord, and to avoid participation in the fruitless deeds of darkness, instead exposing them. It encourages wakefulness, wisdom, making the most of time, understanding God's will, being filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, giving thanks always, and submitting to one another in the fear of Christ. Instructions are given regarding the roles of husbands and wives, emphasizing love and submission."
