    "text_summary": "This passage recounts Jesus appearing to his disciples after his resurrection at the Sea of Tiberias. The disciples, including Peter, are fishing without success. Jesus instructs them to cast their net on the right side of the boat, resulting in a miraculous catch. John recognizes Jesus, and Peter jumps into the water to reach him. They share a meal of fish and bread. Afterward, Jesus questions Peter three times about his love, commissioning him to \"feed my lambs\" and \"tend my sheep,\" foreshadowing Peter's future role as a leader. The passage concludes with a discussion about the disciple John's future, with Jesus implying that it is not Peter's concern. The overall theme is the restoration of Peter, reaffirmation of his faith, and the calling to service, alongside the mystery of God's plan for each individual."
