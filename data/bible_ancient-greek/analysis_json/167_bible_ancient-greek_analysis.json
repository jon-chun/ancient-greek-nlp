    "text_summary": "This passage from Hebrews warns against rejecting God's voice, emphasizing the consequences of disobedience. It contrasts the shaking of the earthly and heavenly realms with the permanence of God's unshakable kingdom. Believers are encouraged to offer acceptable worship with reverence and awe, remembering that God is a consuming fire. The passage stresses brotherly love, hospitality (some unknowingly entertain angels), empathy for prisoners and the afflicted, honoring marriage, and avoiding greed. It encourages contentment and trust in God's provision. The readers are urged to remember their leaders, imitate their faith, and avoid strange teachings. It speaks of Christ's unchanging nature and the need to go outside the camp, bearing His reproach. Finally, it emphasizes offering praise and doing good as sacrifices pleasing to God and obedience to leaders. The text concludes with a prayer for peace and equipping to do God's will through Jesus Christ."
