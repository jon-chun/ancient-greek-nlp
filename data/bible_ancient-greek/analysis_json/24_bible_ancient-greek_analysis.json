    "text_summary": "This passage recounts the final moments of Jesus' crucifixion, including the mocking of onlookers who believed Elijah would save him. It describes Jesus' death, marked by a loud cry and the tearing of the temple veil. A centurion acknowledges Jesus as the Son of God. Several women, including Mary Magdalene and others, witness the events from afar. Joseph of Arimathea requests Jesus' body, buries it in a tomb, and rolls a stone in front of the entrance. After the Sabbath, the women return to anoint the body but find the tomb empty and are told by a young man that Jesus has risen and will meet his disciples in Galilee. The women flee in fear and tell no one. An additional verse states that after rising, Jesus appeared first to Mary Magdalene."
