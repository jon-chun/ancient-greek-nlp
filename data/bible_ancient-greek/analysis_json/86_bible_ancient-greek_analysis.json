    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the Gospel of John in the New Testament, specifically the account of Jesus' arrest, trial before Annas and Caiaphas, Peter's denial, and the beginning of Jesus' trial before Pilate.",
    "text_summary": "The text describes Jesus' arrest by the Jewish authorities and his initial interrogation by Annas, Caiaphas' father-in-law. It recounts Peter's denial of Jesus while warming himself by a fire, and Jesus' subsequent questioning by the high priest regarding his disciples and teachings. Jesus asserts he has spoken openly and challenges them to ask those who heard him. A servant strikes Jesus for his response. Annas sends Jesus, still bound, to Caiaphas. Peter denies Jesus again, and a rooster crows. The scene shifts to Jesus being brought before Pilate, the Roman governor, early in the morning. The Jewish leaders refuse to enter Pilate's residence to avoid ritual defilement before Passover. Pilate questions them about the charges against Jesus, and they state that if Jesus were not a criminal, they wouldn't have brought him. Pilate suggests they judge him according to their own law, but they reply they lack the authority to execute anyone, fulfilling Jesus' earlier prophecy about his death. Pilate then questions Jesus about being the King of the Jews, and Jesus responds by asking if Pilate is asking on his own accord or if others have told him this. Jesus clarifies his kingdom is not of this world."
