    "text_summary": "This passage discusses the apostle Paul's ministry and its impact. He speaks of God's triumph through Christ, spreading the knowledge of God like a fragrance. He describes Christians as the aroma of Christ, perceived differently by those who are saved versus those who are perishing. Paul defends his ministry against accusations of corruption, emphasizing sincerity and divine origin. He contrasts the old covenant, characterized by law and death, with the new covenant of the Spirit, which brings life and glory. The passage highlights the freedom and transformation that come through Christ, and the suffering endured by believers, who find strength and hope in God's power. It concludes with a focus on inner renewal and the eternal weight of glory that outweighs present afflictions."
