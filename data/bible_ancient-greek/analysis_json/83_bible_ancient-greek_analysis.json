    "text_identification": "This appears to be from the New Testament, likely the Gospel of John, based on the themes of love, persecution, the Holy Spirit (Paraclete), and Jesus' relationship with the Father.",
    "text_summary": "This passage from the Gospel of John features Jesus speaking to his disciples, emphasizing their new relationship as friends rather than servants, as he has revealed the Father's will to them. He reminds them that he chose them, not the other way around, and appointed them to bear fruit that will last. He instructs them to love one another. He warns them that the world will hate them because it hated him first, as they are not of the world. He foretells their persecution, even to the point of death, by those who believe they are serving God. Jesus promises the coming of the Paraclete (the Holy Spirit), who will testify about him, and the disciples will also bear witness. He explains that his departure is necessary for the Paraclete to come, who will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment. He states that the Paraclete will guide them into all truth and glorify him. He speaks of a time when they will no longer see him, but then see him again, causing them sorrow that will turn to joy, like a woman in childbirth. He assures them that their sorrow will turn to joy."
